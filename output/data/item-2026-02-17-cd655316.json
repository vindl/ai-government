      "verdict": "neutral",
      "score": 5,
      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers is primarily a labor and social policy measure with no direct environmental intent. However, it carries minor indirect environmental implications — both positive (potential reduction in commercial energy consumption and transport emissions on Sundays) and negative (risk of concentrated shopping on Saturdays increasing peak-hour congestion and waste generation). Overall, the decision is environmentally negligible and does not materially advance or hinder Montenegro's environmental protection agenda or EU Chapter 27 alignment.",
      "executive_summary": "This decision is environmentally neutral. While mandatory Sunday retail closures may yield marginal reductions in commercial energy use and transport emissions, the effects are likely offset by displaced consumer activity. The Ministry of Environment sees no significant impact on its core mandates but recommends leveraging the policy as a platform for broader green Sunday or low-emission zone initiatives.",
      "reasoning": "From the Ministry of Environment's perspective, this law operates almost entirely outside the environmental domain. Its primary purpose is labor rights protection, and its legislative basis is the Law on Internal Trade — not environmental legislation.\n\nThat said, there are several indirect environmental dimensions worth noting:\n\n**Energy and emissions:** Closing retail establishments on Sundays will reduce commercial electricity consumption for one day per week. Given that Montenegro's energy mix still includes significant coal-fired generation from TPP Pljevlja, any reduction in peak demand has a marginal positive effect on emissions. However, this effect is likely very small, as refrigeration, heating, and other baseline loads in retail spaces often continue regardless of operating hours.\n\n**Transport and air quality:** Reduced Sunday retail activity could decrease private vehicle trips to shopping centers, particularly in Podgorica, Nikšić, and coastal municipalities during tourist season. This could temporarily improve local air quality. Conversely, consumers may concentrate their shopping on Saturday, leading to higher peak congestion and associated emissions on that day, partially or fully offsetting any Sunday gains.\n\n**Waste management:** Montenegro already struggles with waste collection capacity and illegal dumping. Concentrated shopping activity on fewer days could lead to waste generation spikes that strain municipal collection systems, particularly in coastal municipalities during the summer season when tourist populations swell. However, this is a marginal concern.\n\n**Coastal zone and tourism:** The law's interaction with Montenegro's tourism-dependent coastal economy is notable. The provision for \"possible legal exceptions in certain sectors necessary to protect public interest\" suggests tourist-facing retail may be exempted. If coastal retail remains open on Sundays during peak season, the environmental effect in the most ecologically sensitive zone (the Adriatic coast) would be essentially zero.\n\n**EU Chapter 27 alignment:** This law has no direct bearing on Montenegro's EU accession negotiations under Chapter 27 (Environment and Climate Change). It does not address any of the chapter's benchmarks related to environmental legislation transposition, implementation capacity, or enforcement.\n\n**Missed opportunity:** The law could have been paired with environmental co-benefits — for example, designating Sundays as reduced-emission days in urban zones, promoting car-free Sunday initiatives, or linking the policy to green public space access. None of these dimensions were incorporated.",

      "score": 5,
      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers is primarily a labor and trade policy matter with limited direct impact on the Ministry of Interior's core mandate. However, it carries several secondary implications for law enforcement operations, administrative capacity, and public order that warrant careful consideration. The law is neither harmful nor beneficial to interior affairs in isolation, but its implementation details — particularly the enforcement mechanism and the scope of exceptions for public-interest sectors — will determine whether it creates new burdens for police and inspectorates.",
      "executive_summary": "This labor-oriented law has marginal direct impact on interior affairs but raises operational questions about enforcement responsibility, exception clauses for essential security-related services, and potential public order concerns during the transition period. The Ministry recommends clarity on which inspectorates enforce compliance and explicit exemptions for security-adjacent retail (e.g., fuel stations near border crossings, pharmacies).",
      "reasoning": "From an interior affairs perspective, this decision is fundamentally a labor and internal trade regulation, placing it outside the Ministry's primary jurisdiction. However, several secondary effects merit analysis.\n\nFirst, regarding enforcement and administrative capacity: The law will require inspection and enforcement of compliance by retail establishments. Montenegro's inspection system is already stretched thin, and it is unclear whether the Market Inspection (Tržišna inspekcija) under the Ministry of Economic Development or local authorities will bear the enforcement burden. If retailers violate the ban, police may be called upon to support inspectors, particularly in cases of repeated non-compliance or public confrontations. This adds a low-level but real operational demand on Uprava policije resources, especially in tourist-heavy municipalities like Budva, Kotor, and Herceg Novi during the summer season.\n\nSecond, regarding public order: The transition period may generate protests or civil disobedience from business owners, particularly small and medium enterprises in coastal and border towns that depend heavily on Sunday trade. The Ministry must be prepared for potential public gatherings or demonstrations, which — while likely peaceful — require police presence and monitoring under the Law on Public Assembly. Montenegro has seen similar mobilizations around economic grievances before.\n\nThird, regarding border management and essential services: The proposed constitutional amendment by President Milatović wisely includes a provision for 'legal exceptions in certain sectors necessary to protect public interest.' This is critical for the Ministry of Interior. Fuel stations near border crossings (e.g., Božaj, Dobrakovo, Debeli Brijeg), pharmacies, and other retail operations that serve border police, civil protection units, and emergency responders must remain operational on Sundays. Any ambiguity in exemption criteria could inadvertently degrade operational readiness at border posts or during civil emergencies.\n\nFourth, regarding organized crime and informal economy: A blanket Sunday closure of retail could inadvertently push some commercial activity into informal or grey-market channels, particularly in municipalities with weaker institutional oversight. While this risk is modest, it is worth monitoring, especially in the context of Montenegro's ongoing EU Chapter 24 commitments to combat the informal economy.\n\nFinally, regarding the extraordinary session procedure: The unanimous 62-0 vote and use of an extraordinary session for what is essentially a labor regulation — rather than an urgent security or crisis matter — raises questions about proportionality of parliamentary procedure. While not a direct interior affairs concern, it reflects a pattern of expedited legislative action that could set precedents for future laws with more direct security implications, potentially bypassing thorough inter-ministerial consultation.",

      "score": 6,
      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers is not a direct education policy measure, but it carries meaningful indirect benefits for the education sector. By guaranteeing a day of rest for retail employees, the law improves conditions for students who work part-time in retail — a significant segment of secondary and university students in Montenegro — and for parents whose availability on Sundays can support children's learning and family stability. The constitutional amendment proposal, however, warrants careful attention to ensure education-related Sunday activities (extracurriculars, university events, exam periods) are explicitly protected under the 'public interest' exceptions.",
      "executive_summary": "The Ministry of Education views this law as modestly positive: it benefits student-workers and family life, both of which support educational outcomes. Our primary concern is ensuring that the constitutional amendment's exception framework explicitly safeguards education-related Sunday activities, and we recommend using this momentum to address broader student labor protections.",
      "reasoning": "The Sunday Rest Law primarily targets the retail sector and labor rights, placing it outside the Ministry of Education's direct mandate. However, several indirect channels of impact are relevant.\n\nFirst, student welfare and equity: A considerable number of secondary school and university students in Montenegro work part-time in retail to support themselves or their families. Montenegro's small economy and relatively low household incomes — especially outside Podgorica and the coastal municipalities — mean that student employment in supermarkets, shops, and seasonal retail is common. Mandatory Sunday rest removes a source of schedule conflict between work and study obligations. Students who previously worked Sundays now have a guaranteed free day that can be used for studying, rest, or family time. This is a net positive for educational equity, as it disproportionately benefits students from lower-income households who are more likely to hold retail jobs.\n\nSecond, family and parental engagement: Research consistently shows that parental involvement improves educational outcomes, particularly in primary and lower secondary education. Parents employed in retail who now have Sundays free are better positioned to engage with their children's schoolwork, attend school-related events, and provide a stable home environment. This is especially relevant in Montenegro where extended family structures and weekend family time play an important cultural role.\n\nThird, vocational education and training (VET): Montenegro's VET system includes practical training placements in the retail sector. The law's impact on VET apprenticeships and practical training schedules must be monitored. If Sunday was used for practical training rotations in retail settings, alternative scheduling will be needed. This is a manageable adjustment but requires coordination between VET schools and employers.\n\nFourth, the proposed constitutional amendment raises a more significant concern. President Milatović's proposal to enshrine Sunday rest at the constitutional level with 'legal exceptions in certain sectors necessary to protect public interest' is broadly worded. Education institutions — universities conducting exams, schools hosting weekend events, libraries, research facilities — must be clearly categorized. The University of Montenegro, for instance, sometimes schedules exam periods or academic events on Sundays. If the constitutional provision is poorly drafted, it could inadvertently create legal ambiguity around education-sector Sunday operations.\n\nFifth, regarding brain drain mitigation, the law sends a signal that Montenegro is improving worker protections and quality of life, which aligns with EU labor standards. This is a soft but real factor in retaining young educated Montenegrins who compare domestic working conditions with those in EU member states. Better labor protections reduce one push factor for emigration, though the effect should not be overstated — salary gaps and career opportunities remain the dominant drivers of brain drain.\n\nFinally, from an EU education standards alignment perspective, the law is broadly consistent with EU practice. Many EU member states have Sunday trading restrictions, and the European Social Charter recognizes the right to weekly rest. This normative alignment is positive for Montenegro's EU accession process, even if it is not directly within the education acquis.",

      "verdict": "positive",
      "score": 7,
      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers is a broadly positive public health measure that aligns with evidence on the benefits of predictable rest days for worker wellbeing, mental health, and work-life balance. However, the Ministry of Health has significant concerns about the law's impact on pharmaceutical access, particularly for rural and underserved populations, and the lack of explicit provisions ensuring continuity of healthcare-adjacent retail services such as pharmacies, medical supply stores, and opticians.",
      "executive_summary": "The Ministry of Health views this law positively for worker wellbeing and mental health but flags a critical gap: without clear exemptions or duty-roster systems for pharmacies and healthcare-adjacent retail, patient safety and medication access—especially in rural Montenegro—could be compromised. We recommend immediate adoption of a pharmacy duty-roster regulation before the law takes effect.",
      "reasoning": "From a public health perspective, mandatory rest days are well-supported by occupational health literature. Retail workers in Montenegro, many of whom are women working irregular hours for relatively low wages, stand to benefit from improved sleep patterns, reduced chronic stress, and better family and social cohesion—all of which are upstream determinants of health. The unanimous parliamentary support signals broad political consensus, which is itself a positive signal for worker protection norms aligned with EU social policy.\n\nHowever, the Ministry of Health must raise several domain-specific concerns. First and most critically, the law as described does not appear to explicitly address pharmacies. In Montenegro, many pharmacies operate within or alongside retail spaces, and in smaller municipalities (e.g., Šavnik, Plužine, Žabljak), a single pharmacy may serve the entire local population. If pharmacies are classified under 'internal trade' without exemption, Sunday closures could create dangerous gaps in medication access, particularly for chronic disease patients (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions) and for emergency contraception or acute pain management. The existing pharmacy network already has geographic access challenges documented by the RFZO and the Institute for Public Health (IJZ).\n\nSecond, the proposed constitutional amendment by President Milatović does mention 'possible legal exceptions in certain sectors necessary to protect public interest,' which is encouraging. However, the constitutional amendment process is slow, and the operational law takes effect immediately upon gazette publication. There is a temporal gap during which pharmacy access could be disrupted before any exemption framework is formalized.\n\nThird, the law may have indirect positive effects on healthcare system capacity. Retail workers who currently work Sundays often delay or skip medical appointments. A guaranteed rest day could improve preventive care uptake and reduce emergency department visits that result from deferred primary care—a persistent problem at the Clinical Center of Montenegro (KCCG) and regional hospitals.\n\nFourth, regarding health workforce implications, the law sets a precedent for worker rest protections. While healthcare workers are presumably exempt, the political momentum could support future advocacy for better shift scheduling, rest periods, and burnout prevention in the health sector—where Montenegro faces severe brain drain to EU countries (Germany, Slovenia, Croatia). Demonstrating that Montenegro takes worker wellbeing seriously could marginally help retention.\n\nOn EU alignment, this law is broadly consistent with the EU Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC), which requires a minimum weekly rest period of 24 consecutive hours, with Sunday as the preferred rest day in many member states. Several EU countries (Germany, Austria, Croatia) have similar Sunday trading restrictions with healthcare exemptions. Montenegro's approach is compatible with Chapter 19 (Social Policy) and indirectly supports Chapter 28 (Consumer and Health Protection) objectives, provided healthcare access continuity is maintained.\n\nThe key risk is implementation without adequate healthcare sector carve-outs. The law's immediate effect upon gazette publication leaves little time for secondary regulation on pharmacy duty rosters, which are standard practice in EU countries with Sunday rest laws (e.g., Croatia's 'dežurne ljekarne' system).",

      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers, while socially motivated, introduces meaningful fiscal risks for Montenegro's economy. The mandatory closure of retail on Sundays will reduce aggregate retail turnover, compress VAT and other consumption tax revenues, and create downward pressure on GDP growth at a time when Montenegro needs sustained economic expansion to meet EU convergence criteria. The unanimous passage without apparent fiscal impact assessment or transition period is particularly concerning from a public finance standpoint.",
      "executive_summary": "The Ministry of Finance views this law as fiscally problematic. Mandatory Sunday retail closures will reduce VAT revenues, dampen tourism-linked consumption, and risk deterring foreign retail investment — all without an apparent impact assessment or phased implementation. We recommend a delayed effective date with sectoral exemptions and a mandatory fiscal impact review.",
      "reasoning": "Montenegro's retail sector is a significant contributor to VAT revenues, which constitute one of the largest components of the state budget. VAT revenues in recent years have accounted for roughly 40-45% of total tax revenues, and retail trade — particularly in coastal municipalities during the tourism season — is a primary driver. Sunday is typically one of the highest-turnover days for retail, especially in Podgorica, Budva, Kotor, and other tourist-heavy areas. Reducing the trading week by one full day, approximately 14% of available retail hours, will mechanically compress turnover and, by extension, VAT collection.\n\nThe tourism dimension is especially critical. Montenegro's economy is heavily tourism-dependent (tourism contributes approximately 20-25% of GDP directly and indirectly). Foreign tourists, particularly during the May-October high season, expect Sunday retail availability. Coastal retail closures on Sundays will redirect spending to neighboring countries (Croatia, Albania) or to informal/grey economy channels, neither of which benefits the state budget.\n\nFrom a foreign direct investment perspective, international retail chains evaluating market entry into Montenegro (a small market of ~620,000 people) will factor in operational restrictions. Sunday closures reduce revenue potential per store location, making Montenegro less attractive relative to regional peers. Serbia, Albania, and North Macedonia do not have equivalent blanket Sunday closure laws for retail. This regulatory divergence may discourage investment in a sector that Montenegro needs to modernize.\n\nRegarding EU accession criteria, while the EU does not prohibit Sunday trading restrictions (several EU members have them, notably Germany, Austria, and parts of France), those countries implemented such rules within the context of much larger, diversified economies with robust fiscal buffers. Montenegro, with a debt-to-GDP ratio hovering around 60-65% and a budget of approximately €2 billion, has far less fiscal room to absorb revenue shortfalls. The Maastricht deficit criterion (3% of GDP) requires disciplined revenue management, and any policy that reduces tax collection without offsetting measures is a concern.\n\nThe absence of a fiscal impact assessment prior to passage is a serious procedural gap. The extraordinary session format and rapid legislative timeline suggest this was driven by political rather than evidence-based policymaking. No publicly available analysis quantifies the expected revenue loss, the impact on employment (potential reduction in part-time retail jobs), or the effect on the grey economy. The Ministry of Finance should have been formally consulted before passage.\n\nThe constitutional amendment proposal by President Milatović raises additional long-term concerns. Enshrining Sunday rest at the constitutional level would make future economic policy adjustments extremely difficult. If fiscal circumstances require loosening retail restrictions (e.g., during an economic downturn or tourism crisis), a constitutional provision would create a near-insurmountable barrier to rapid policy response.\n\nIt should be noted that the law does have social merit — retail workers in Montenegro often face exploitative scheduling practices, and a guaranteed rest day has legitimate welfare value.

      "verdict": "positive",
      "score": 6,
      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law is a constitutionally permissible exercise of parliamentary legislative power that advances workers' rights in line with European social policy traditions. However, the process raises rule-of-law concerns — the use of an extraordinary session for a non-emergency social policy measure, the absence of a meaningful public consultation period, and the unanimity of the vote all suggest insufficient deliberative scrutiny. The parallel proposal to constitutionalize Sunday rest is disproportionate and risks rigidifying labor policy in ways that may complicate EU accession negotiations and economic flexibility.",
      "executive_summary": "The Ministry of Justice views this law as substantively legitimate but procedurally rushed. The extraordinary session mechanism was misused for a non-urgent matter, depriving stakeholders of adequate consultation. The proposed constitutional amendment to enshrine Sunday rest is unnecessary, disproportionate, and risks creating legal conflicts with EU internal market freedoms.",
      "reasoning": "**Constitutional Compliance.** The Montenegrin Constitution (Article 62) guarantees the right to work and fair working conditions, and Article 64 provides for the right to limited working hours and paid leave. Parliament has clear competence under the Constitution to regulate internal trade conditions, and mandating a weekly rest day falls within the margin of legislative discretion. The law itself does not appear to violate any constitutional provision. However, the proposed constitutional amendment by President Milatović to enshrine the right to Sunday rest at the constitutional level raises serious concerns. Constitutionalizing a specific day of rest goes well beyond what is necessary to protect workers' rights — it elevates a policy preference to a fundamental right, making future adjustments (e.g., liberalization of retail hours as economic conditions or EU obligations evolve) extraordinarily difficult. The Venice Commission has consistently advised against over-constitutionalization of matters better left to ordinary legislation.\n\n**Rule of Law and Legislative Process.** The use of an extraordinary parliamentary session is the most significant procedural concern. The Rules of Procedure of the Montenegrin Parliament permit extraordinary sessions, but their purpose is to address urgent matters that cannot wait for regular sessions. A Sunday rest law for retail workers, while socially significant, does not meet any reasonable threshold of urgency. The proposal was submitted on January 28 and passed on February 16 — a period of less than three weeks — which is insufficient for meaningful committee deliberation, expert consultation, regulatory impact assessment, or public participation. The unanimity (62-0) is notable: while consensus can be positive, in a pluralistic parliament it may also indicate that dissenting voices — including those of affected businesses, consumers, and minority worker groups — were not adequately represented or heard. The Ministry of Justice notes that the Law on State Administration and various government guidelines require regulatory impact assessments (RIA) for significant legislative changes. There is no indication that a proper RIA was conducted.\n\n**Human Rights Considerations.** The right to rest is recognized under Article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2 of the European Social Charter, and EU Directive 2003/88/EC (Working Time Directive), which requires a minimum weekly rest period of 24 consecutive hours. Mandating Sunday as the specific rest day is common in many EU member states (Germany, Austria, and others have similar restrictions). However, this must be balanced against other rights: (1) the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights); (2) the right to work for employees who may prefer or need Sunday employment for economic reasons; and (3) potential indirect discrimination concerns — mandating Sunday specifically has religious connotations that could affect workers of non-Christian faiths who may prefer a different rest day. The law should include adequate exception mechanisms and reasonable accommodation provisions.\n\n**EU Legal Harmonization.** Under Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and Chapter 24, Montenegro is expected to demonstrate alignment with EU standards on fundamental rights and rule of law. The Working Time Directive does not mandate Sunday as the rest day — it requires one day per week, with the choice of day left to member states. Many EU member states do restrict Sunday trading, so the substance of the law is not inherently incompatible with the acquis. However, the manner of adoption — rushed, without proper impact assessment, through an extraordinary session — is inconsistent with the principles of good governance and better regulation that the European Commission monitors closely in accession countries. Furthermore, constitutionalizing Sunday rest could create future friction with EU internal market rules (specifically the Services Directive 2006/123/EC) if it prevents Montenegro from adapting its regulatory framework during accession negotiations.\n\n**Anti-Corruption and Transparency.** While this law does not directly engage anti-corruption concerns, the speed and unanimity of its passage warrant scrutiny. Legislation that bypasses normal deliberative processes can create conditions where special interests operate without public accountability. The Ministry notes no evidence of corruption in this specific instance, but the precedent of using extraordinary sessions for non-emergency social legislation weakens institutional safeguards against future abuse.\n\n**Judicial Independence.** The law does not directly affect judicial independence. However, if the constitutional amendment proceeds, any future challenges to Sunday rest exceptions would fall to the Constitutional Court, potentially politicizing its docket with labor-policy disputes that are better resolved through ordinary legislative processes.",

      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers is broadly compatible with EU law, as the EU Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC) requires a minimum weekly rest period of 24 consecutive hours but does not mandate which day must be designated as the rest day. Several EU member states maintain similar Sunday trading restrictions (Germany, Austria, Poland, parts of France). The law does not create a direct obstacle to EU accession, but the manner of adoption — through an extraordinary parliamentary session, unanimous vote with no meaningful debate, and a simultaneous push for constitutional entrenchment — raises procedural concerns about regulatory quality and the maturity of Montenegro's legislative process, which are relevant to Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and Chapter 3 (Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services).",
      "executive_summary": "The Sunday rest law is not incompatible with EU acquis, as the Working Time Directive leaves member states discretion on weekly rest arrangements and many EU countries restrict Sunday trading. However, the rushed extraordinary session procedure and the proposal to elevate this to constitutional level are disproportionate and raise concerns about legislative quality — a recurring criticism in European Commission progress reports. The Ministry recommends future labor reforms follow standard legislative procedures with proper impact assessments and stakeholder consultation.",
      "reasoning": "From an EU acquis perspective, the core substance of this law is within the margin of appreciation afforded to member states. The EU Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC), transposed under Chapter 19 (Social Policy and Employment), requires a minimum 24-hour uninterrupted weekly rest period, with a reference period of 14 days. It does not prescribe Sunday specifically. Germany's Ladenschlussgesetz, Austria's Öffnungszeitengesetz, and Poland's 2018 Sunday trading ban all demonstrate that restricting Sunday retail activity is fully compatible with EU membership.\n\nHowever, several aspects of this decision warrant scrutiny from an EU integration standpoint:\n\nFirst, regarding Chapter 3 (Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services): blanket Sunday closures in retail can be challenged as restrictions on the freedom to provide services. The European Court of Justice addressed this in cases like Stoke-on-Trent (C-169/91) and Punto Casa (C-69/93), ultimately finding that non-discriminatory Sunday trading rules are compatible with EU law provided they apply equally to domestic and foreign operators and are proportionate. The law as described appears non-discriminatory, but the absence of clearly defined exceptions — beyond a vague reference to 'sectors necessary to protect public interest' in the presidential constitutional proposal — could create legal uncertainty for foreign investors and service providers operating in Montenegro.\n\nSecond, regarding Chapter 19 (Social Policy and Employment): the law aligns with the spirit of EU social policy, which values work-life balance. The European Pillar of Social Rights and the Work-Life Balance Directive (2019/1158) support the principle of adequate rest. This is a positive signal.\n\nThird, and most critically, regarding Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and overall rule of law benchmarks: the European Commission's annual progress reports on Montenegro have consistently flagged concerns about the quality of the legislative process, including insufficient public consultation, inadequate regulatory impact assessments, and rushed parliamentary procedures. This law was proposed on January 28 and adopted at an extraordinary session on February 16 — a turnaround of less than three weeks. Unanimous votes of 62 out of 81 MPs, while politically notable, do not substitute for rigorous impact assessment, stakeholder consultation (employers' associations, trade unions, consumer organizations, SMEs), and proper parliamentary committee review. The push to simultaneously enshrine this in the Constitution is disproportionate by European standards — no EU member state has Sunday rest for retail workers at the constitutional level in this manner, and it signals a tendency toward constitutional inflation that could complicate future legislative flexibility needed for acquis alignment.\n\nFourth, regarding IPA funding: there is no direct impact on IPA programming. However, the EU consistently conditions reform funding on evidence of mature, consultative legislative processes. A pattern of extraordinary-session legislation undermines Montenegro's credibility in demonstrating institutional readiness.\n\nFinally, in the regional context: Croatia, as a neighboring EU member, has had an ongoing and contentious debate about Sunday trading restrictions, with multiple legislative reversals. Montenegro should learn from Croatia's experience that such laws require carefully calibrated exemptions (tourism zones, border areas, seasonal provisions) to avoid economic disruption, especially given Montenegro's heavy dependence on tourism — a sector where Sunday closures could have significant commercial implications if exemptions are not properly defined.",

      "score": 3,
      "summary": "The Sunday Rest Law for retail workers, while addressing legitimate labor rights concerns, represents a blunt regulatory intervention that will disproportionately harm Montenegro's tourism-dependent economy, reduce SME competitiveness, and send a concerning signal to foreign investors. The unanimous passage without apparent economic impact assessment, the rushed extraordinary session procedure, and the proposed constitutional entrenchment of what should be a flexible labor policy all point to a decision driven primarily by political signaling rather than sound economic policymaking.",
      "executive_summary": "This law will materially damage Montenegro's retail sector and tourism competitiveness — sectors that together account for a dominant share of GDP and employment. The Ministry of Economy's top concern is the absence of exemptions for tourism zones and seasonal retail, and the constitutional amendment proposal which would make future economic adjustment nearly impossible. We recommend the law be amended before gazette publication to include geographic and seasonal exemptions.",
      "reasoning": "Montenegro is a small, open, services-driven economy where tourism contributes approximately 25% of GDP directly and significantly more indirectly. The retail sector is deeply intertwined with tourism — coastal towns like Budva, Kotor, Herceg Novi, and Tivat see peak commercial activity on weekends, including Sundays, particularly during the May-October season when the country receives the vast majority of its international visitors. A blanket Sunday closure mandate for retail will directly reduce revenue opportunities during the most commercially productive days of the week.\n\nFrom a labor market perspective, the retail sector is one of Montenegro's largest employers, particularly for women, young workers, and those with lower formal qualifications. While the intention to protect workers' rest days is commendable and aligned with certain EU member state practices, the implementation matters enormously. Countries like Germany and Austria that maintain Sunday trading restrictions have much larger, more diversified economies and well-developed compensatory mechanisms (higher wages, shift premiums, strong collective bargaining). Montenegro has none of these structural supports in place. The likely immediate labor market effect is not better working conditions but rather reduced hours, lower total compensation for hourly workers, and potential job losses — particularly in SMEs that operate on thin margins and depend on Sunday revenue.\n\nThe SME impact is especially concerning. Montenegro's retail landscape is dominated by small and micro enterprises. Large chains can absorb a one-seventh revenue reduction more easily through operational efficiencies and omnichannel strategies. Small shop owners — particularly family-run businesses in tourist areas — will face an existential threat. Many of these businesses earn a disproportionate share of weekly revenue on Sundays. There was no apparent consultation with the Chamber of Economy, the Employers' Federation, or SME associations before this extraordinary session.\n\nFor foreign direct investment, the signal is troubling on two levels. First, investors in retail, hospitality-adjacent commerce, and mixed-use real estate developments (such as Porto Montenegro or Lustica Bay) will face operational constraints that reduce projected returns. Second, and more importantly, the process — an extraordinary parliamentary session with unanimous passage and no visible impact assessment — raises governance and regulatory predictability concerns. FDI thrives on stable, predictable regulatory environments. The additional proposal to constitutionalize this right elevates the concern dramatically: constitutional provisions are extraordinarily difficult to amend, meaning any future government that recognizes the economic damage will face near-impossible barriers to correction.\n\nComparing with EU practice: while several EU member states restrict Sunday trading, none have constitutionalized such restrictions, and most include extensive exemptions for tourism areas, transport hubs, seasonal periods, and small businesses. Croatia, a direct competitor and neighbor, allows Sunday trading in tourist zones. If Montenegro closes while Croatian coastal towns remain open, cross-border shopping leakage will increase, particularly in the Bay of Kotor area near Dubrovnik.\n\nThe energy and industrial policy dimensions are minimal, though the reduction in commercial operating hours will marginally reduce energy consumption — a negligible benefit that does not offset the economic costs.\n\nThe procedural dimension cannot be ignored. An extraordinary session called on January 28 with a vote on February 16 — less than three weeks — for a law affecting tens of thousands of workers and thousands of businesses, with no published regulatory impact assessment, no public consultation period, and no transition period, is not consistent with good regulatory practice or Montenegro's EU accession commitments under Chapter 3 (Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services) and Chapter 8 (Competition Policy).",

      "verdict": "negative",
      "score": 3,
      "summary": "While the Ministry of Tourism recognizes the legitimate social objective of protecting retail workers' rights to rest, a blanket Sunday closure law for retail without explicit, well-defined tourism exemptions poses a serious operational threat to Montenegro's tourism sector, which generates approximately 40% of GDP and is overwhelmingly concentrated in the May–October season. Sunday is one of the highest-revenue days for coastal and national park destinations, and the law as passed risks degrading visitor experience, damaging Montenegro's competitiveness against Croatia, Albania, and Greece, and undermining the livelihoods of seasonal workers who depend on peak-period earnings.",
      "executive_summary": "The Sunday rest law, while socially well-intentioned, threatens to significantly disrupt Montenegro's tourism-dependent economy by closing retail on one of the busiest visitor days. The absence of a clear, automatic tourism-sector exemption is the core deficiency. The Ministry recommends immediate adoption of a seasonal exemption framework for tourism zones and a compensatory rest model for affected workers.",
      "reasoning": "Montenegro's tourism model is fundamentally incompatible with a rigid Sunday retail closure. Several dimensions of impact must be considered:\n\n**1. Revenue and Visitor Experience Impact.** Sunday is consistently among the top two spending days for tourists across Budva, Kotor, Tivat, Herceg Novi, and Ulcinj. Cruise ship arrivals in Kotor — which can bring 5,000–10,000 visitors in a single day — frequently fall on Sundays. These visitors have limited time ashore (typically 6–8 hours) and expect to shop, dine, and engage with local commerce. A closed retail environment on Sundays would directly translate to lost revenue for local businesses and a diminished visitor experience, with reputational consequences amplified through online reviews and cruise line feedback.\n\n**2. Seasonal Employment and Labour Dynamics.** Approximately 25,000–30,000 seasonal workers depend on the May–October tourism window for the bulk of their annual income. Many of these workers are employed in retail, souvenir shops, and market stalls in coastal towns. A Sunday closure reduces their available earning days by roughly 14% during the season. While the intent is to protect workers, the effect on seasonal employees — who are often on fixed-term contracts and paid hourly or daily — may be the opposite: reduced income without meaningful improvement in working conditions. The law appears designed with year-round, urban retail workers in mind, not the seasonal tourism workforce.\n\n**3. Competitiveness Against Regional Rivals.** Croatia, Greece, and Albania — Montenegro's direct competitors — all maintain flexible Sunday trading regimes in tourist zones during high season. Croatia's Trade Act explicitly exempts municipalities with significant tourism activity. If Montenegro closes on Sundays while Dubrovnik, Saranda, and Corfu remain open, tourists and tour operators will adjust itineraries accordingly. This is especially damaging for day-trip and cruise traffic, which is highly price- and convenience-elastic.\n\n**4. National Park and Ecotourism.** Durmitor, Biogradska Gora, Skadar Lake, Prokletije, and Lovćen increasingly attract weekend visitors — both domestic and international. Sunday closures of retail points within or adjacent to park areas (visitor centres, souvenir shops, local produce stalls) would undermine the agritourism and rural development strategies the Ministry has been promoting, particularly in northern Montenegro where economic alternatives are scarce.\n\n**5. Constitutional Enshrinement Risk.** President Milatović's proposal to constitutionally enshrine Sunday rest is particularly alarming from a tourism policy perspective. Constitutional provisions are extremely difficult to amend or create exceptions to. If Sunday rest becomes a constitutional right without explicit carve-outs for tourism, future flexibility to adapt to market conditions, EU accession requirements, or seasonal demands would be severely constrained. EU member states generally handle Sunday trading through ordinary legislation precisely to maintain policy flexibility.\n\n**6. EU Alignment.** The EU does not mandate Sunday closures; this is left to member states. However, the EU Services Directive and internal market principles generally discourage blanket restrictions on commercial activity that disproportionately affect cross-border service provision, including tourism. As Montenegro progresses through EU accession (Chapters 3 and 19 are relevant), rigid Sunday closure rules without tourism exemptions could be flagged as a barrier to services liberalisation.\n\n**7. The Law's Silence on Exemptions.** The most critical deficiency is what the law does not say. The text as reported provides for a blanket non-working Sunday for retail employees. While the President's constitutional proposal mentions 'possible legal exceptions in certain sectors necessary to protect public interest,' the law itself — which takes immediate effect — does not appear to contain a tourism exemption mechanism. This creates immediate legal uncertainty for thousands of tourism-facing retail businesses ahead of the 2026 season, which begins in approximately 10 weeks.",

    ],
    "overall_analysis": "This decision is a textbook case of populist legislating dressed up as worker protection. The core problem is not the policy goal — giving retail workers a day of rest is a legitimate aim shared by many EU member states. The problems are threefold: process, substance, and constitutional integrity.\n\n**Process failure.** A law affecting tens of thousands of workers and thousands of businesses was rammed through an extraordinary parliamentary session in under three weeks, with no regulatory impact assessment, no stakeholder consultation, no transition period, and no fiscal analysis. The 62-0 vote is not consensus — it is the absence of scrutiny. Every ministry that assessed this law noted the procedural deficiencies, which is damning.\n\n**Substantive failure.** The law is a blunt instrument applied to a nuanced problem. Montenegro is not Germany or Austria — it is a micro-economy of 620,000 people where tourism generates 25-40% of GDP and where the 2026 summer season starts in 10 weeks. Passing a blanket Sunday retail closure with no tourism exemption, no seasonal carve-out, no small-business threshold, and no pharmacy duty-roster requirement is policy malpractice. Croatia, the nearest EU comparator, learned through painful experience that Sunday trading restrictions require calibrated exemptions for tourist zones, small stores, and essential services. Montenegro skipped the learning and went straight to the mistake.\n\n**Constitutional crisis.** The most alarming dimension — largely underweighted by the ministry assessments — is that Montenegro's Constitutional Court had previously struck down a nearly identical Sunday closure provision as unconstitutional, finding it violated entrepreneurial freedom and equal treatment principles. Parliament's response was to re-enact essentially the same provision, and the President's response was to propose constitutionally enshrining it to override the Court entirely. This is not worker protection — this is a coordinated assault on judicial independence. In any EU accession country, legislative override of Constitutional Court rulings is a Chapter 23 red flag of the highest order. The European Commission will notice.\n\n**Assessment quality.** The ministry assessments are generally competent and substantive — significantly better than rubber-stamping. The Ministries of Finance, Economy, Tourism, and Justice all raised serious, well-reasoned objections. The Ministry of Justice in particular identified the rule-of-law concerns clearly. The Health Ministry raised the critical pharmacy access gap. The weaker assessments came from Environment and Interior, which stretched to find relevance but added little. The Education Ministry's assessment was reasonable but somewhat tangential. Overall, the ministries did their analytical jobs — the problem is that the parliament clearly ignored all of it.\n\n**Who benefits?** PES called this extraordinary session. The political calculus is transparent: retail workers are a large, sympathetic voting bloc, Sunday rest is emotionally resonant, and no opposition MP wants to be seen voting against workers' weekends. This was a zero-cost popularity play for PES — zero cost politically, that is. The economic and institutional costs will be borne by small business owners, seasonal workers who lose Sunday income, tourists who find shuttered shops, and Montenegro's constitutional order.\n\n**Bottom line.** The right to weekly rest is a legitimate policy goal that Montenegro should pursue — through ordinary legislative procedure, with a proper impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, tourism exemptions, a transition period, and in compliance with its own Constitutional Court's rulings. What happened instead was a political stunt that undermines the rule of law, threatens the tourism economy, and will almost certainly face another constitutional challenge. Montenegro deserves better governance than this.",

    "headline_mne": "Parlament prkosi sopstvenim sudovima radi jeftinih političkih poena zabranom rada nedjeljom",
    "overall_analysis_mne": "Ova odluka je školski primjer populističkog zakonodavstva presvučenog u radničku zaštitu. Suštinski problem nije politički cilj — davanje radnicima u maloprodaji dana odmora legitiman je cilj koji dijele mnoge države članice EU. Problemi su trostruki: postupak, sadržaj i ustavni integritet.\n\n**Procesni propust.** Zakon koji pogađa desetine hiljada radnika i hiljade preduzeća provučen je kroz vanrednu sjednicu parlamenta za manje od tri sedmice, bez procjene regulatornog uticaja, bez konsultacija s akterima, bez prijelaznog perioda i bez fiskalne analize. Glasanje 62-0 nije konsenzus — to je odsustvo nadzora. Svako ministarstvo koje je razmatralo ovaj zakon ukazalo je na proceduralne nedostatke, što je porazno.\n\n**Suštinski propust.** Zakon je tupo oruđe primijenjeno na slojevit problem. Crna Gora nije Njemačka ni Austrija — to je mikroekonomija od 620.000 stanovnika u kojoj turizam generiše 25–40% BDP-a, a ljetnja sezona 2026. počinje za 10 sedmica. Donošenje sveobuhvatne zabrane rada maloprodaje nedjeljom bez izuzetka za turizam, bez sezonskih odredbi, bez praga za mala preduzeća i bez zahtjeva za dežurstvo apoteka predstavlja političku malpraksu. Hrvatska, najbliži uporedni primjer iz EU, kroz bolno iskustvo naučila je da ograničenja nedeljne trgovine zahtijevaju pažljivo kalibrisane izuzetke za turističke zone, male prodavnice i ključne usluge. Crna Gora je preskočila učenje i direktno napravila grešku.\n\n**Ustavna kriza.** Najalarmantnija dimenzija — koju su ministarstva u velikoj mjeri potcijenila — jeste da je Ustavni sud Crne Gore ranije ukinuo gotovo identičnu odredbu o nedeljnom zatvaranju kao neustavnu, utvrdivši da krši slobodu preduzetništva i načelo jednakog tretmana. Odgovor Parlamenta bio je da suštinski istu odredbu ponovo usvoji, a odgovor predsjednika bio je prijedlog da se ona ugradi u Ustav kako bi se Sud u potpunosti zaobišao. Ovo nije zaštita radnika — ovo je koordinisani napad na nezavisnost pravosuđa. U svakoj zemlji kandidatu za EU, zakonodavno poništavanje odluka Ustavnog suda predstavlja crvenu zastavicu najvišeg reda u okviru Poglavlja 23. Evropska komisija će to primijetiti.\n\n**Kvalitet procjena.** Ministarstvene procjene su općenito kompetentne i suštinski utemeljene — znatno bolje od pukog odobravanja. Ministarstva finansija, ekonomije, turizma i pravde iznijela su ozbiljne i dobro obrazložene primjedbe. Ministarstvo pravde posebno je jasno identifikovalo zabrinutosti vezane za vladavinu prava. Ministarstvo zdravlja ukazalo je na kritičan problem dostupnosti apoteka. Slabije procjene dolaze od Ministarstva ekologije i Ministarstva unutrašnjih poslova, koja su se trudila pronaći relevantnost, ali su malo doprinijela. Procjena Ministarstva prosvjete bila je razumna, ali donekle sporedna. Ukupno gledano, ministarstva su obavila svoj analitički posao — problem je što ih je parlament očigledno ignorisao.\n\n**Ko ima koristi?** PES je sazvao ovu vanrednu sjednicu. Politički kalkul je transparentan: radnici u maloprodaji su brojna i simpatična glasačka baza, nedeljni odmor emocionalno odzvanja, a nijedan poslanik opozicije ne želi biti viđen kako glasa protiv vikenda radnika. Ovo je bila popularizatorska igra bez ikakve cijene za PES — politički bez cijene, to jest. Ekonomske i institucionalne troškove snosiće vlasnici malih preduzeća, sezonski radnici koji gube nedeljnu zaradu, turisti koji nailaze na zatvorene prodavnice, i ustavni poredak Crne Gore.\n\n**Zaključak.** Pravo na sedmični odmor legitiman je politički cilj koji Crna Gora treba da ostvaruje — kroz redovnu zakonodavnu proceduru, uz valjanu procjenu uticaja, konsultacije s akterima, izuzetke za turizam, prijelazni period i u skladu s odlukama sopstvenog Ustavnog suda. Umjesto toga, desio se politički trik koji podriva vladavinu prava, prijeti turističkoj ekonomiji i gotovo sigurno će se suočiti s novim ustavnim osporavanjem. Crna Gora zaslužuje bolju vlast od ove.",

      "Ustavni sud je ranije ukinuo sličnu odredbu o nedeljnom zatvaranju kao neustavnu — njeno ponovno usvajanje bez otklanjanja ustavnih nedostataka predstavlja direktno zakonodavno poništavanje sudske kontrole i ozbiljno kršenje vladavine prava",
      "Nijedno ministarstvo nije eksplicitno identifikovalo političku motivaciju PES-a za sazivanje vanredne sjednice o populističkom radnom pitanju — ovo nosi sve odlike izbornog pozicioniranja, a ne politike zasnovane na dokazima",

      "Nula analize interakcije zakona s crnogorskom sivom ekonomijom — procijenjenom na 25–30% BDP-a — gdje će nedeljno zatvaranje formalne maloprodaje jednostavno preusmjeriti potrošnju ka neregulisanim prodavcima",
      "Nijedno ministarstvo nije se bavilo vremenskom apsurdnošću: zakon stupa na snagu odmah po objavljivanju u Službenom listu bez prijelaznog perioda, što znači da preduzeća nemaju apsolutno nikakvo vrijeme da prilagode kadrove, ugovore ili poslovanje",

      "Nijedno ministarstvo nije analiziralo preferencije radnika — mnogi zaposleni u maloprodaji, posebno studenti i sezonski radnici, aktivno žele nedeljne smjene zbog premijuma u zaradi ili fleksibilnosti rasporeda"

  "counter_proposal": {
    "decision_id": "sunday-rest-law-2026-02-17",
    "title": "Phased Sunday Rest Law with Tourism Exemptions, Fiscal Safeguards, and Worker Protection Standards",
    "executive_summary": "The AI Government of Montenegro would pursue the same core objective — guaranteed weekly rest for retail workers — but through a properly calibrated framework: mandatory Sunday closure for large retail chains year-round nationwide, with a seasonal tourism-zone exemption system (May–October) for SMEs and tourism-facing retail, mandatory 50% Sunday wage premiums for exempted workers, a pharmacy duty-roster system, and abandonment of the constitutional amendment in favor of flexible statutory protection subject to an 18-month evidence-based review. Critically, the law would have been adopted through regular parliamentary procedure with a full regulatory impact assessment and stakeholder consultation, not an extraordinary session.",
    "detailed_proposal": "The unified counter-proposal preserves the unanimous parliament's legitimate social objective — protecting retail workers from exploitative seven-day scheduling — while addressing the serious economic, procedural, healthcare, and rule-of-law deficiencies identified across all seven ministries.\n\n**Core Framework: Tiered Sunday Rest.** The backbone of the proposal draws from the Ministry of Economy's tiered model, reinforced by the Ministry of Tourism's seasonal exemption structure. Large retail operations (50+ employees) would observe mandatory Sunday closure year-round nationwide. This targets the businesses most associated with worker exploitation while sparing SMEs and micro-enterprises that are disproportionately harmed by blanket closures. All other retail establishments would observe Sunday closure from November through April, but would be eligible for exemption in designated Tourism Activity Zones from May 1 through October 31. This directly addresses the Ministry of Tourism's central concern: Montenegro's tourism sector generates approximately 25-40% of GDP, Sunday is one of the highest-revenue days in coastal towns, and cruise arrivals in Kotor frequently fall on Sundays. A blanket closure without seasonal exemptions would damage competitiveness against Croatia, Albania, and Greece — all of which maintain flexible Sunday trading in tourist areas.\n\n**Tourism Activity Zones.** Drawing on the Ministry of Tourism's proposal, the Government would designate Tourism Activity Zones by decree, covering coastal municipalities (Budva, Kotor, Tivat, Herceg Novi, Ulcinj, Bar), national park gateway towns (Žabljak, Kolašin), and UNESCO-adjacent areas (Cetinje). Municipal tourism boards would apply annually for zone designation, ensuring local accountability. This mirrors Croatia's Trade Act exemption model and Germany's Ladenschlussgesetz tourist-area provisions.\n\n**Worker Protection in Exempted Zones.** The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Tourism both converge on the principle that Sunday work, where permitted, must carry a mandatory wage premium. Workers in exempted zones who work Sundays would receive a minimum 50% wage premium and a guaranteed compensatory rest day within the same week. This achieves the social protection objective through economic incentive rather than blanket prohibition, ensuring seasonal workers — approximately 25,000-30,000 people who depend on the May-October window for the bulk of their annual income — are not harmed by reduced earning capacity.\n\n**Pharmacy and Healthcare Access.** The Ministry of Health's counter-proposal is adopted almost in full as a non-negotiable component. A Pharmacy Sunday Duty Regulation would be adopted simultaneously with the trade law, establishing mandatory duty pharmacies: at least one per municipality, with 3-4 in Podgorica and 2 in Nikšić. The RFZO would maintain a real-time duty pharmacy registry (web portal, call center, SMS). Medical supply stores serving chronic disease patients would also be exempted. This draws directly on Croatia's 'dežurne ljekarne' system and addresses a genuine patient safety gap, particularly in rural municipalities with single-pharmacy coverage.\n\n**Security and Border Operations.** Per the Ministry of Interior's recommendations, fuel stations near border crossings (Božaj, Dobrakovo, Debeli Brijeg), airport and port retail, and emergency supply stores would be explicitly exempted through implementing bylaws developed in consultation with the Border Police Directorate. Enforcement responsibility would rest exclusively with the Market Inspectorate, with police involvement limited to public order situations — preventing mission creep onto already-stretched Uprava policije resources.\n\n**Legislative Process Reform.** The Ministry of Justice and Ministry of EU Integration raise the most fundamental objection: not to what the law does, but how it was done. An extraordinary session for a non-emergency social policy measure, with less than three weeks from proposal to adoption, no regulatory impact assessment, no public consultation, and a 62-0 vote that suggests insufficient deliberative scrutiny, is inconsistent with rule-of-law standards the European Commission monitors under Chapter 23. The unified counter-proposal would have pursued adoption through regular parliamentary procedure with full committee review, public hearings, and a commissioned RIA analyzing effects on retail employment, tourism revenue, SME viability, consumer access, and VAT collection. This adds 60-90 days to the timeline — a modest delay overwhelmingly justified by the institutional credibility gained with the European Commission.\n\n**Abandonment of the Constitutional Amendment.** Every ministry that addressed the constitutional proposal — Justice, Finance, Economy, Tourism, and EU Integration — opposed it. This is the strongest consensus across the entire cabinet. No EU member state has constitutionalized Sunday rest for retail workers in this manner. The Venice Commission has consistently advised against over-constitutionalization of matters better left to ordinary legislation. Constitutional entrenchment would eliminate future policy flexibility needed for EU accession negotiations (particularly regarding the Services Directive 2006/123/EC), make economic correction virtually impossible during downturns, and risk politicizing the Constitutional Court's docket with labor-policy disputes. Sunday rest is adequately and appropriately protected at the statutory level.\n\n**Anti-Discrimination Safeguard.** The Ministry of Justice uniquely identified a religious freedom dimension: mandating Sunday specifically as the rest day has Christian connotations that could disadvantage workers of other faiths. The unified proposal includes a reasonable accommodation clause allowing individual workers to request an alternative weekly rest day on religious or personal grounds, consistent with EU anti-discrimination principles.\n\n**Environmental Co-Benefits.** The Ministry of Environment's 'Green Sunday' proposals are incorporated as voluntary municipal initiatives rather than mandatory requirements: car-free urban zones, enhanced public green space programming, and reduced public transport fares on Sundays. Municipalities would also be required to assess and adapt waste collection schedules to account for shifted shopping patterns, particularly Saturday spikes.\n\n**Student and Education Protections.** The Ministry of Education's proposals are integrated through two mechanisms: (1) explicit protection of education-sector Sunday activities (university exams, library operations, research facilities) under the public interest exception framework, and (2) coordination with VET institutions to adjust practical training schedules in retail settings without reducing total training hours. The proposed Student Employment Code (maximum 15 hours/week for secondary, 20 for university students) is flagged for separate legislation rather than incorporation into this law, to avoid scope creep.\n\n**Monitoring and Review.** A mandatory 18-month review clause would require the Government to publish a comprehensive impact assessment covering: VAT revenue effects, retail employment changes, tourism spending patterns, informal economy indicators, pharmacy access complaints, emergency department visit patterns, and seasonal worker income data. Parliament would reconfirm or amend the law based on this evidence. This replaces the constitutional amendment's permanence with an evidence-driven, adaptive approach.",

    "risks_and_tradeoffs": [
      "Political risk: The original law passed 62-0, indicating overwhelming political consensus for a blanket approach. Proposing a more nuanced framework may face resistance as appearing to weaken worker protections, despite achieving the same substantive objective through better-calibrated means",
      "Presidential friction: Formally opposing the constitutional amendment directly challenges President Milatović's initiative, creating potential tension between the Government and the presidency — a recurring dynamic in Montenegro's semi-presidential system",
      "Delay risk: The 6-month implementation timeline means the law would not take effect until approximately August-September 2026, meaning the first full tourism season (2027) would be the real test. Workers would not receive Sunday protection until then, creating a gap the original law avoided",
      "Tourism exemption scope creep: Once exemptions exist, political and business pressure to expand them could gradually hollow out the Sunday rest principle. The annual municipal application process is designed to contain this but requires disciplinary enforcement",
      "Enforcement complexity: A tiered system with seasonal exemptions is inherently more complex to enforce than a blanket ban. The Market Inspectorate's capacity to monitor compliance across different enterprise sizes, zones, and seasons is uncertain",
      "Wage premium compliance: The 50% Sunday premium depends on effective labor inspection, which is historically weak in Montenegro, particularly for seasonal workers on informal or semi-formal contracts. Without enforcement, the premium becomes a paper right",
      "Partial environmental benefits lost: By keeping tourism-zone retail open on Sundays during peak season, the marginal environmental benefits (reduced transport, energy consumption) identified by the Ministry of Environment are diminished in the areas with the highest activity",
      "Compromise satisfies no one fully: The Ministry of Economy and Tourism would prefer even broader exemptions; the original law's proponents would prefer no exemptions. This framework occupies defensible middle ground but may lack a passionate political constituency"

    "title_mne": "Fazni Zakon o Nedeljnom Odmoru sa Izuzecima za Turizam, Fiskalnim Zaštitama i Standardima Zaštite Radnika",
    "executive_summary_mne": "AI Vlada Crne Gore bi se rukovodila istim ključnim ciljem — garantovanim sedmičnim odmorom za radnike u maloprodaji — ali kroz pravilno kalibrisani okvir: obavezno nedeljno zatvaranje velikih maloprodajnih lanaca tokom cijele godine na teritoriji cijele države, sa sistemom sezonskih izuzeća za turističke zone (maj–oktobar) za MSP i maloprodaju orijentisanu ka turizmu, obaveznim nedeljnim uvećanjem plate od 50% za radnike obuhvaćene izuzecima, sistemom dežurnih apoteka, te odustajanjem od ustavnog amandmana u korist fleksibilne zakonske zaštite podložne reviziji zasnovanoj na dokazima nakon 18 mjeseci. Od ključne važnosti je to što bi zakon bio usvojen redovnom parlamentarnom procedurom uz punu procjenu regulatornog uticaja i konsultacije sa zainteresovanim stranama, a ne vanrednom sjednicom.",
    "detailed_proposal_mne": "Objedinjeni kontra-prijedlog čuva legitimni socijalni cilj jednoglasnog parlamenta — zaštitu radnika u maloprodaji od eksploatatorskog sedmodnevnog raspoređivanja — uz istovremeno otklanjanje ozbiljnih ekonomskih, proceduralnih, zdravstvenih nedostataka i nedostataka u pogledu vladavine prava, identifikovanih u svih sedam ministarstava.\n\n**Osnovni okvir: Stepenovani nedeljni odmor.** Okosnica prijedloga crpi iz stenovitog modela Ministarstva ekonomije, ojačanog strukturom sezonskih izuzeća Ministarstva turizma. Velike maloprodajne radnje (50+ zaposlenih) primjenjivale bi obavezno nedeljno zatvaranje tokom cijele godine na teritoriji cijele države. Ovo cilja na preduzeća koja se najčešće dovode u vezu s eksploatacijom radnika, istovremeno štiteći MSP i mikro-preduzeća koja su nesrazmjerno pogođena generalnim zatvaranjem. Sve ostale maloprodajne radnje primjenjivale bi nedeljno zatvaranje od novembra do aprila, ali bi bile podobne za izuzeće u određenim Zonama turističke aktivnosti od 1. maja do 31. oktobra. Ovo direktno adresira centralnu brigu Ministarstva turizma: turistički sektor Crne Gore generiše oko 25–40% BDP-a, nedjelja je jedan od dana s najvećim prihodom u primorskim gradovima, a kruzeri u Kotoru često pristaju nedjeljom. Opšte zatvaranje bez sezonskih izuzeća narušilo bi konkurentnost u odnosu na Hrvatsku, Albaniju i Grčku — koje sve održavaju fleksibilnu nedeljnu trgovinu u turističkim oblastima.\n\n**Zone turističke aktivnosti.** Oslanjajući se na prijedlog Ministarstva turizma, Vlada bi uredbom označila Zone turističke aktivnosti, obuhvatajući primorske opštine (Budva, Kotor, Tivat, Herceg Novi, Ulcinj, Bar), gradove na ulazima u nacionalne parkove (Žabljak, Kolašin) i područja u blizini UNESCO lokaliteta (Cetinje). Opštinska turistička vijeća podnošila bi godišnje zahtjeve za određivanje zone, čime se osigurava lokalna odgovornost. Ovo odražava model izuzeća Zakona o trgovini Hrvatske i odredbe o turističkim područjima njemačkog Ladenschlussgesetz-a.\n\n**Zaštita radnika u zonama izuzeća.** Ministarstvo finansija i Ministarstvo turizma slažu se u načelu da nedeljni rad, tamo gdje je dozvoljen, mora nositi obavezno uvećanje plate. Radnici u zonama izuzeća koji rade nedjeljom dobijali bi minimalno 50% uvećanje plate i garantovani kompenzatorni odmor unutar iste sedmice. Time se postiže cilj socijalne zaštite putem ekonomskog podsticaja, a ne generalnom zabranom, čime se osigurava da sezonski radnici — oko 25.000–30.000 ljudi koji zavise od prozora maj–oktobar za većinu godišnjeg prihoda — nisu oštećeni smanjenim mogućnostima zarade.\n\n**Pristup apotekama i zdravstvenoj zaštiti.** Kontra-prijedlog Ministarstva zdravlja usvojen je gotovo u cijelosti kao nezaobilazna komponenta. Uredba o nedeljnom dežurstvu apoteka usvojena bi bila istovremeno sa zakonom o trgovini, uspostavljajući obavezne dežurne apoteke: najmanje jednu po opštini, s 3–4 u Podgorici i 2 u Nikšiću. RFZO bi vodio registar dežurnih apoteka u realnom vremenu (web portal, pozivni centar, SMS). Radnje s medicinskim potrepštinama za pacijente s hroničnim bolestima bile bi takođe izuzete. Ovo se direktno oslanja na hrvatski sistem 'dežurnih ljekarni' i adresira stvaran jaz u bezbjednosti pacijenata, naročito u ruralnim opštinama s jedinom apotekom.\n\n**Bezbjednost i granične operacije.** U skladu s preporukama Ministarstva unutrašnjih poslova, benzinske pumpe u blizini graničnih prelaza (Božaj, Dobrakovo, Debeli Brijeg), maloprodajni objekti na aerodromima i lukama te prodavnice za hitne slučajeve bili bi eksplicitno izuzeti podzakonskim aktima razvijenim u konsultaciji s Upravom granične policije. Nadležnost za sprovođenje bila bi isključivo na Tržišnoj inspekciji, uz angažovanje policije ograničeno na situacije narušavanja javnog reda — čime se sprječava misionarsko širenje na već preopterećene resurse Uprave policije.\n\n**Reforma zakonodavnog procesa.** Ministarstvo pravde i Ministarstvo evropskih integracija iznose najsuštastveniiji prigovor: ne onome što zakon čini, već tome kako je to urađeno. Vanredna sjednica za mjeru socijalne politike koja nije hitna, s manje od tri sedmice od prijedloga do usvajanja, bez procjene regulatornog uticaja, bez javnih konsultacija i glasanjem 62-0 koje ukazuje na nedovoljnu deliberativnu provjeru, nije u skladu sa standardima vladavine prava koje Evropska komisija prati u okviru Poglavlja 23. Objedinjeni kontra-prijedlog predvidio bi usvajanje redovnom parlamentarnom procedurom uz potpuni pregled u odboru, javna saslušanja i naručenu PRI koja analizira efekte na zaposlenost u maloprodaji, prihode od turizma, životnu sposobnost MSP-a, pristup potrošača i naplatu PDV-a. Ovo dodaje 60–90 dana na vremenski okvir — skroman odgod koji je apsolutno opravdan institucionalnim kredibilitetom stečenim pred Evropskom komisijom.\n\n**Odustajanje od ustavnog amandmana.** Svako ministarstvo koje se bavilo ustavnim prijedlogom — Pravde, Finansija, Ekonomije, Turizma i Evropskih integracija — protivilo mu se. Ovo je najsnažniji konsenzus u čitavom kabinetu. Nijedna zemlja članica EU nije na ovaj način konstitucionalizovala nedeljni odmor za radnike u maloprodaji. Venecijanska komisija dosljednom savjetuje protiv prekomjerne konstitucionalizacije pitanja koja je bolje ostaviti redovnom zakonodavstvu. Ustavno utvrđivanje eliminisalo bi buduću fleksibilnost politike potrebnu za pregovore o pristupanju EU (naročito u pogledu Direktive o uslugama 2006/123/EC), učinilo bi ekonomsku korekciju gotovo nemogućom u periodima recesije i rizikuje da politizuje ulogu Ustavnog suda sporovima o radnoj politici. Nedeljni odmor adekvatno je i prikladno zaštićen na zakonskom nivou.\n\n**Zaštita od diskriminacije.** Ministarstvo pravde jedinstveno je identifikovalo dimenziju vjerske slobode: obavezno određivanje upravo nedjelje kao dana odmora ima hrišćanske konotacije koje bi mogle dovesti u neravnopravan položaj radnike drugih vjera. Objedinjeni prijedlog uključuje klauzulu o razumnoj prilagodbi kojom se pojedinim radnicima omogućava da zahtijevaju alternativni sedmični odmor iz vjerskih ili ličnih razloga, u skladu s EU principima antidiskriminacije.\n\n**Ekološke ko-koristi.** Prijedlozi 'Zelene nedjelje' Ministarstva ekologije integrisani su kao dobrovoljne opštinske inicijative, a ne obavezni zahtjevi: zone bez automobila u urbanim sredinama, unaprijeđeno programiranje javnih zelenih površina i snižene cijene karata javnog prevoza nedjeljom. Od opština bi se takođe zahtijevalo da procijene i prilagode rasporede sakupljanja otpada kako bi uzele u obzir promijenjene obrasce kupovine, naročito subotnje skokove.\n\n**Zaštita studenata i obrazovanja.** Prijedlozi Ministarstva prosvjete integrisani su putem dva mehanizma: (1) eksplicitnom zaštitom nedeljnih aktivnosti obrazovnog sektora (univerzitetski ispiti, rad biblioteka, istraživačke ustanove) u okviru izuzeća od javnog interesa, i (2) koordinacijom sa ustanovama strukovnog obrazovanja radi prilagođavanja rasporeda praktične obuke u maloprodajnim okruženjima bez smanjenja ukupnog broja sati obuke. Predloženi Kodeks zapošljavanja studenata (maksimalno 15 sati/sedmično za učenike srednje škole, 20 za studente) predložen je za zasebno zakonodavstvo, a ne za ugradnju u ovaj zakon, kako bi se izbjeglo proširivanje opsega.\n\n**Praćenje i revizija.** Obavezna klauzula o reviziji nakon 18 mjeseci zahtijevala bi od Vlade da objavi sveobuhvatnu procjenu uticaja koja obuhvata: efekte na prihode od PDV-a, promjene u zaposlenosti u maloprodaji, obrasce turističke potrošnje, pokazatelje sive ekonomije, pritužbe u vezi s pristupom apotekama, obrasce posjeta hitnoj službi i podatke o prihodima sezonskih radnika. Parlament bi na osnovu ovih dokaza potvrdio ili izmijenio zakon. Ovim se ustavna trajna zaštita zamjenjuje pristupom zasnovanim na dokazima i prilagodljivim rješenjima.",

    "risks_and_tradeoffs_mne": [
      "Politički rizik: Originalni zakon usvojen je glasanjem 62-0, što ukazuje na premoćan politički konsenzus za generalni pristup. Predlaganje preciznijeg okvira može naići na otpor kao čin slabljenja zaštite radnika, uprkos postizanju istog suštinskog cilja boljim sredstvima",
      "Tenzije s predsjednikom: Formalno protivljenje ustavnom amandmanu direktno osporava inicijativu predsjednika Milatovića, stvarajući potencijalnu napetost između Vlade i predsjedništva — povremenu dinamiku u crnogorskom polupredsjedničkom sistemu",
      "Rizik od odgode: Rok za primjenu od 6 mjeseci znači da zakon ne bi stupio na snagu do otprilike avgusta–septembra 2026. godine, što znači da bi prva puna turistička sezona (2027) bila pravi test. Radnici ne bi primali nedeljnu zaštitu do tada, stvarajući jaz koji je originalni zakon izbjegao",
      "Proširivanje opsega izuzeća za turizam: Kada izuzeća postoje, politički i poslovni pritisak za njihovo proširenje mogao bi postepeno potkopati princip nedeljnog odmora. Godišnji proces opštinskog podnošenja zahtjeva osmišljen je da to ograniči, ali zahtijeva disciplinovano sprovođenje",
      "Složenost sprovođenja: Stepenovani sistem sa sezonskim izuzecima inherentno je složeniji za sprovođenje od generalne zabrane. Kapacitet Tržišne inspekcije za praćenje usklađenosti u različitim veličinama preduzeća, zonama i sezonama je neizvjestan",
      "Usklađenost s uvećanjem plate: 50% nedeljnog uvećanja zavisi od djelotvornog rada inspekcije rada, koja je istorijski slaba u Crnoj Gori, naročito za sezonske radnike na neformalnim ili poluformannim ugovorima. Bez sprovođenja, uvećanje ostaje puko pravo na papiru",
      "Izgubak dijela ekoloških koristi: Zadržavanjem maloprodaje u turističkim zonama otvorenom nedjeljom u toku sezone, granične ekološke koristi (smanjenje saobraćaja, potrošnje energije) koje je identifikovalo Ministarstvo ekologije umanjene su u oblastima s najvećom aktivnošću",
      "Kompromis ne zadovoljava u potpunosti nikog: Ministarstvo ekonomije i turizma preferiralo bi još šira izuzeća; zagovornici originalnog zakona preferirali bi nikakva izuzeća. Ovaj okvir zauzima odbranjivo srednje tlo, ali mu možda nedostaje strasna politička podrška"
