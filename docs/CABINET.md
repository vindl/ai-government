# The Cabinet

The AI Government of Montenegro operates through nine ministry-specific agents, each responsible for analyzing government decisions within its domain.

| # | Ministry | Scope |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Finance** | Fiscal policy, budget oversight, public debt management, tax policy, and EU economic convergence criteria. |
| 2 | **Justice** | Rule of law, judiciary independence, anti-corruption enforcement, and EU Chapters 23/24 compliance. |
| 3 | **EU Integration** | Accession negotiation tracking, acquis alignment assessment, and benchmark monitoring. |
| 4 | **Health** | Public health policy, healthcare system governance, and pharmaceutical regulation and procurement. |
| 5 | **Interior** | Public safety, police reform, border management, and migration policy. |
| 6 | **Education** | Education quality and reform, scientific research, vocational education and training (VET), and brain drain mitigation. |
| 7 | **Economy** | Economic development strategy, foreign direct investment (FDI), labour market policy, industrial policy, and SME support. |
| 8 | **Tourism** | Tourism regulation and development, seasonal employment, coastal and national park management, and cruise ship policy. |
| 9 | **Environment** | Environmental protection, waste management, climate policy, EU Chapter 27 alignment, and spatial planning. |

## Selection Criteria

The nine ministries are selected proportionally to their impact on Montenegrin public life. The selection is not arbitrary; it reflects a weighted assessment across five dimensions:

- **GDP share** — How much of the national economy does the sector directly influence?
- **Budget allocation** — What proportion of public spending flows through the domain?
- **EU accession chapter relevance** — Does the domain correspond to active or critical negotiation chapters?
- **Decision frequency** — How often does the government produce consequential decisions in this area?
- **Corruption risk** — How exposed is the sector to procurement irregularities, conflicts of interest, or opacity?

A ministry earns its seat by scoring highly across multiple dimensions. A sector that is economically significant but generates few government decisions (e.g., remittances) would not justify a dedicated agent. Conversely, a sector with high decision frequency but low public impact would not qualify either.

## Ministry-by-Ministry Rationale

### Finance

The Ministry of Finance controls a national budget of approximately 2 billion EUR and shapes every other policy domain through fiscal allocation. Montenegro's unique position — using the euro without European Central Bank membership — creates monetary policy constraints that make fiscal discipline unusually consequential. Budget transparency, public debt trajectory, and tax policy are foundational to EU accession and directly affect every citizen.

### Justice

EU Chapters 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and 24 (Justice, Freedom, and Security) serve as the opening and closing benchmarks of Montenegro's accession process — no progress is possible without them. Corruption consistently ranks as the top public concern in domestic surveys. Judicial independence, prosecution effectiveness, and anti-corruption body performance are areas where government rhetoric and reality frequently diverge, making independent analysis essential.

### EU Integration

EU accession is Montenegro's defining policy trajectory. It shapes legislation, institutional reform, budget priorities, and foreign policy. A dedicated ministry agent tracks negotiation chapter progress, acquis alignment, and benchmark fulfilment across all 33 chapters. Without this cross-cutting view, the relationship between individual ministry decisions and the overall accession timeline would be invisible.

### Health

Montenegro's small health system serves a population of roughly 620,000 and operates under chronic strain — limited specialist capacity, facility maintenance backlogs, and pharmaceutical procurement that has historically lacked transparency. Health decisions directly affect citizens' wellbeing and frequently involve significant public expenditure with limited competitive tendering.

### Interior

Police reform and internal affairs oversight are prerequisites for EU accession under Chapters 23 and 24. Border management is a live issue as Montenegro prepares for Schengen-adjacent obligations. Organized crime networks operating across the Western Balkans make law enforcement effectiveness a matter of both domestic safety and international credibility.

### Education

Brain drain is an existential risk for a country of 620,000 people. Montenegro's PISA scores consistently fall below the EU average, and the gap between educational output and labour market demand drives emigration among young graduates. Education reform, research investment, and vocational training policy determine whether the country retains the human capital needed to function as an EU member state.

### Economy

Industrial policy, FDI regulation, and the SME ecosystem shape Montenegro's economic diversification beyond tourism dependence. Energy transition decisions — including the future of coal production and renewable investment — carry multi-decade consequences. Labour market regulation and regional development policy determine whether economic growth is broadly shared or concentrated in the coastal strip.

### Tourism

Tourism contributes approximately 40% of GDP when indirect effects are included, making it the single largest economic sector. The industry is highly seasonal, creating boom-bust employment cycles. Kotor faces UNESCO pressure over uncontrolled development near its World Heritage site. Coastal construction permits, national park concessions, and cruise ship regulation are high-stakes decisions where commercial interests and public goods collide.

### Environment

EU Chapter 27 (Environment and Climate Change) is the most demanding accession chapter by volume of legislation and cost of compliance. The Pljevlja thermal power plant remains a significant pollution source. Montenegro faces a waste management crisis with inadequate landfill capacity and recycling infrastructure. Spatial planning decisions — particularly along the coast — have irreversible consequences for biodiversity and landscape integrity.

## What's Intentionally Excluded

Not every government function warrants a dedicated ministry agent. The following areas are deliberately excluded, with analysis absorbed by existing ministries where relevant:

- **Agriculture** — A comparatively small sector at roughly 6% of GDP. Rural development and agricultural subsidy decisions are analyzed under Economy's scope. A standalone agent would generate limited insight relative to its cost.

- **Transport** — Infrastructure decisions are analyzed through Finance (budget allocation and procurement) and Environment (environmental impact assessments). Transport does not generate a sufficient volume of independent policy decisions to justify a dedicated agent.

- **Defence** — Montenegro has been a NATO member since 2017. Defence policy generates minimal domestic controversy and few consequential unilateral decisions. Alliance obligations are largely predetermined.

- **Culture and Media** — Media freedom issues, which are the most consequential decisions in this domain, are captured by Justice through its rule-of-law analysis. The Critic agent's blind-spot detection mechanism provides an additional safeguard against systematic omission of press freedom concerns.

- **Labour** — Employment policy and labour market regulation fall under Economy. Workers' rights, trade union protections, and labour law enforcement are analyzed under Justice. Splitting these into a standalone agent would create redundancy without improving coverage.

## The One-In-One-Out Principle

The cabinet roster is capped at nine ministries. This is a deliberate constraint, not a temporary limitation.

Adding a ministry increases API costs, orchestration complexity, and the cognitive load on downstream consumers of the analysis (readers, social media audiences, other agents). Each additional agent must justify its existence not only by covering an important domain but by covering one that is not already adequately served by the existing nine.

If a compelling case emerges for a new ministry — for example, a Digitalization ministry as e-government policy accelerates — it must be accompanied by a proposal to fold an existing ministry's scope into another. The total count does not increase.

## The Swing Seat

**EU Integration** is designated as the swing seat.

EU accession is the defining policy context for Montenegro today, but it is not permanent. As accession either concludes successfully or stalls indefinitely, the marginal value of a dedicated EU Integration agent will decline. At that point, EU compliance monitoring can be absorbed into each ministry's individual scope, and the freed seat can be allocated to an emerging domain — Digitalization, Energy, or another area that has grown in decision frequency and public impact.

The swing seat designation does not diminish EU Integration's current importance. It is a forward-looking architectural decision that acknowledges policy contexts change and the cabinet must be able to adapt without exceeding its size constraint.
