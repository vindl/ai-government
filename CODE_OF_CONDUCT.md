# Code of Conduct

## Project Principles

This project operates under a [Constitution](docs/CONSTITUTION.md) that binds all contributors — human and AI. Key principles:

- **Public loyalty**: The sole client is the Montenegrin public (Art. 1)
- **Truth and transparency**: Never distort, omit, or spin (Art. 4)
- **Nonpartisanship**: Judge actions, not actors (Art. 18)
- **Correct mistakes publicly**: Credibility is built by admitting errors (Art. 24)
- **Do no harm**: Analyze institutions, not private citizens (Art. 25)

The Constitution governs project decisions, analytical standards, and agent behavior.

## Interpersonal Conduct

For interactions in Discussions, Issues, and pull requests, this project adopts the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

In summary:

- Be respectful, constructive, and welcoming
- No harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Critique ideas and analyses, not people
- Discussions in Montenegrin are welcome; keep it civil regardless of language

The project maintainer is responsible for enforcing this code of conduct. Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported by opening a post in [Corrections](https://github.com/vindl/ai-government/discussions/categories/corrections) or by contacting the maintainer directly.
