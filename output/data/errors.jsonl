The Ministry of Education has no objections but sees no reason to treat this as an education-relevant decision.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe new Competition Protection Law is primarily an economic regulatory measure with no direct impact on education policy, curricula, student welfare, or teacher workforce development. However, its EU harmonization dimension has indirect positive signaling value for Montenegro's accession process, which broadly benefits the education sector through continued access to EU pre-accession funds and programmes like Erasmus+. The education system is neither meaningfully helped nor harmed by this decision.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- No direct impact on education quality, equity, or workforce development\\n- Risk that government highlights EU harmonization in economic chapters while neglecting education-specific acquis alignment (Chapter 26)\\n- No provisions addressing competition in education-adjacent markets such as textbook publishing, digital learning platforms, or school catering services\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Ensure that the government's EU harmonization agenda gives equal priority to Chapter 26 (Education and Culture) alongside economic chapters\\n- Consider whether the strengthened Competition Protection Agency should examine concentration and pricing practices in the textbook and educational materials market, which affects student welfare\\n- Use the momentum of EU alignment reforms to advance the pending National Qualifications Framework updates and VET system modernization\\n- Leverage the broader accession narrative to secure continued and expanded Erasmus+ and Horizon Europe participation for Montenegrin students and researchers\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Parallel EU Alignment Push for Education Acquis**\\nRather than objecting to the competition law, the Ministry of Education would propose that each EU harmonization initiative in economic chapters be accompanied by a corresponding education sector review, ensuring that Montenegro's accession progress is balanced across all chapters and that education reform does not fall behind.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Establish a cross-ministerial coordination mechanism linking economic and education EU harmonization timelines\\n- Task the Competition Protection Agency with a sectoral review of education-adjacent markets (textbooks, edtech, school services)\\n- Accelerate Chapter 26 benchmarks in parallel with Chapter 8 progress\\n- Publish an annual education EU alignment scorecard alongside economic reform progress reports\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Environment\\n**Verdict**: neutral (5/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: The Competition Protection Law reform has no direct environmental impact but offers indirect benefits by potentially curbing anti-competitive practices in environmentally sensitive sectors such as waste management and energy. The Ministry of Environment views this as a missed opportunity to embed environmental conditionality into competition enforcement, particularly given Montenegro's ongoing struggles with waste sector monopolies and non-transparent concession practices in coastal zones.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThis competition law reform is primarily an economic governance matter with limited direct environmental impact. However, a stronger competition framework can indirectly benefit environmental objectives by preventing monopolistic practices in waste management, energy markets, and construction sectors that sometimes undermine environmental standards. The decision is a positive step for overall EU accession alignment but does not address Montenegro's pressing environmental challenges.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The law contains no explicit provisions linking competition enforcement to environmental protection or sustainability objectives\\n- Waste management sector monopolies in multiple municipalities may not be specifically targeted despite being a critical environmental governance issue\\n- No coordination mechanism between the Competition Protection Agency and environmental regulatory bodies (EPA, Ministry of Environment) is mentioned\\n- The law does not address anti-competitive practices in coastal zone construction and land development that fuel illegal building\\n- Risk that strengthened competition enforcement in the energy sector could be used to protect incumbent fossil fuel interests rather than facilitate the green energy transition\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a formal memorandum of understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency to share information on market practices affecting environmentally sensitive sectors\\n- Introduce provisions allowing environmental impact to be considered as a factor in competition assessments, in line with the EU's evolving Green Deal competition framework\\n- Prioritize competition investigations in the waste management sector, where monopolistic practices directly undermine circular economy goals and EU Chapter 27 alignment\\n- Ensure the law's implementation guidelines address anti-competitive practices in public procurement for environmental infrastructure (wastewater treatment plants, waste facilities, renewable energy projects)\\n- Include the Ministry of Environment as a consultative body when the Agency investigates mergers or practices in sectors with significant environmental footprint (energy, construction, waste, extractive industries)\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Green Competition Framework Integration**\\nThe Ministry of Environment would advocate for amending the draft law to include a sustainability clause, requiring the Competition Protection Agency to consider environmental externalities in its assessments and to prioritize enforcement in sectors with significant environmental impact. This would align with the European Commission's evolving approach to integrating sustainability into competition policy and would create synergies between Chapter 8 and Chapter 27 accession efforts.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a sustainability consideration clause to the Agency's mandate, mirroring EU developments under the Green Deal competition policy review\\n- Mandate inter-agency cooperation protocols between the Competition Agency, the EPA, and the Ministry of Environment for cases involving environmentally sensitive sectors\\n- Include specific provisions targeting anti-competitive practices in waste management concessions and municipal service contracts\\n- Require environmental impact screening for merger reviews in energy, construction, extractive industries, and tourism sectors\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Interior\\n**Verdict**: positive (6/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This law is a net positive for interior affairs despite being outside our direct mandate. Its strongest value lies in creating an empowered agency that can serve as a force multiplier against economic and organized crime. Our key recommendation is to establish formal inter-agency cooperation protocols between the Competition Protection Agency and the Police Directorate to ensure intelligence sharing on cases where anti-competitive behavior overlaps with criminal activity.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe new Competition Protection Law is primarily an economic regulation matter outside the Ministry of Interior's core mandate, but it carries meaningful indirect benefits for organized crime enforcement and administrative capacity building. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's investigative powers and independence creates a parallel institutional track that can complement law enforcement efforts against economic crime, cartel arrangements, and corruption networks that often intersect with organized crime in Montenegro.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- No apparent provisions for formal inter-agency cooperation between the Competition Protection Agency and law enforcement bodies (Police Directorate, SDT)\\n- Risk of insufficient staffing and resourcing — Montenegro has a pattern of creating strong legal frameworks without matching institutional capacity\\n- Expanded investigative powers without robust oversight mechanisms could lead to selective enforcement or political misuse\\n- Digital forensics and evidence-handling standards must be compatible with criminal procedure requirements if cases are referred for prosecution\\n- The law does not appear to address the intersection of anti-competitive behavior with organized crime, which is a documented pattern in the Western Balkans\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a formal Memorandum of Understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Police Directorate for intelligence sharing on cases involving suspected criminal activity\\n- Advocate for inclusion of a mandatory referral clause requiring the Agency to notify the Special State Prosecutor when investigations reveal evidence of criminal conduct (bid-rigging, fraud, money laundering)\\n- Coordinate training programs so that Agency investigators and police economic crime units develop complementary forensic accounting and digital evidence capabilities\\n- Ensure the Agency's digital investigation tools and evidence-handling protocols are aligned with national cybersecurity standards and criminal evidence admissibility requirements\\n- Push for transparent appointment procedures and external oversight of the Agency to prevent institutional capture, drawing on EU best practices from DG Competition\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Integrated Economic Crime Enforcement Framework**\\nRather than treating competition enforcement as a standalone economic matter, the Ministry of Interior would advocate for embedding this law within a broader integrated economic crime enforcement framework. This would create mandatory cooperation channels between the Competition Protection Agency, the Police Directorate's Organized Crime Unit, the SDT, and the Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering, ensuring that anti-competitive conduct linked to criminal networks is pursued through both administrative and criminal tracks simultaneously.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a mandatory inter-agency referral mechanism to the draft law requiring notification of law enforcement when investigations reveal indicators of criminal conduct\\n- Create a joint analytical unit staffed by Competition Agency and Police Directorate analysts to identify overlap between anti-competitive practices and organized crime\\n- Include provisions for joint training and secondment programs between the Agency and the Ministry of Interior's investigative units\\n- Establish a shared secure digital platform for exchanging case-relevant intelligence within legal data protection boundaries\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare\\n**Verdict**: positive (6/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This competition law reform is a welcome step for EU alignment and consumer protection, with indirect benefits for workers through fairer markets and stronger purchasing power. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is concerned that no labour impact assessment or worker protection safeguards accompany the enhanced enforcement regime, and recommends that social dialogue mechanisms and employment transition provisions be integrated before adoption.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe strengthening of Montenegro's Competition Protection Agency and alignment with EU competition standards is a broadly positive development for workers and social welfare, though it operates at an indirect level. Healthy competition policy protects consumers (including low-income households) from price-fixing and cartel behaviour, can improve labour market conditions by preventing monopsony power over wages, and advances Montenegro's EU accession process under Chapter 8 (Competition Policy), which indirectly supports Chapter 19 (Social Policy and Employment). However, the draft law as described contains no explicit labour or social safeguards, and high corporate fines without transitional support could trigger workforce reductions in affected firms.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- No labour impact assessment accompanies the draft law — potential workforce reductions at firms facing large fines are unaddressed\\n- No evidence of consultation with the Social Council (Socijalni savjet) or trade unions during the drafting process, contrary to ILO Convention No. 144 on tripartite consultation\\n- High fines (up to 10% of global revenue) applied to domestically-owned SMEs could trigger insolvency and unemployment in a small economy with limited alternative employment\\n- The law does not address labour market competition violations (employer wage-fixing, no-poach agreements) — a growing area of enforcement in the EU and OECD\\n- Downstream fiscal burden on the Employment Bureau (Zavod za zapošljavanje) and Fond PIO if enforcement actions lead to job losses is not accounted for\\n- No transitional provisions or phased enforcement timelines to allow firms — and their workers — to adapt to the new regime\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Require a mandatory labour and social impact assessment for any Competition Agency enforcement action involving fines above a defined threshold, with notification to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare\\n- Engage the Social Council (Socijalni savjet) in a formal consultation round before the law is finalised, ensuring trade union and employer association input on labour market implications\\n- Include provisions addressing labour market competition violations — specifically employer wage-fixing agreements and no-poach clauses — in line with evolving EU and OECD best practice\\n- Establish a transitional support mechanism coordinated with the Employment Bureau to provide retraining, severance support, or active labour market measures for workers displaced by enforcement-triggered restructuring\\n- Introduce proportionality safeguards for fines on SMEs, recognising their outsized role as employers in Montenegro's labour market\\n- Coordinate with Chapter 19 negotiation team to ensure competition law reform is presented as a synergistic contribution to the social policy and employment acquis\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Socially Integrated Competition Enforcement Framework**\\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare proposes that the Competition Protection Law be amended to include a social impact dimension. Rather than opposing the reform, we would embed labour safeguards directly into the enforcement architecture: mandatory social impact assessments for major enforcement actions, explicit coverage of labour market anti-competitive practices, proportionality provisions for SME employers, and a standing coordination protocol between the Competition Agency and the Employment Bureau. This ensures that competition enforcement strengthens rather than destabilises the labour market.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a new article requiring the Competition Agency to conduct or commission a labour market impact assessment before imposing fines exceeding 2% of a firm's domestic revenue\\n- Expand the definition of anti-competitive practices to include employer wage-fixing agreements and no-poach clauses affecting workers\\n- Introduce a proportionality clause for SMEs employing more than 50 workers, allowing phased fine payment or remedial compliance plans as alternatives to immediate full fines\\n- Establish a formal coordination protocol between the Competition Agency and the Employment Bureau for cases where enforcement may result in workforce reductions exceeding 20 employees\\n- Mandate Social Council consultation as part of the legislative review process for this and future competition law amendments\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Justice\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: The Ministry of Justice views this draft law favorably as a necessary step in EU accession alignment, but flags serious concerns about the absence of clear procedural safeguards for expanded investigative powers, the need for proportionality guarantees in the fining regime, and the adequacy of judicial review. Our key recommendation is to embed due process protections directly into the law's text rather than leaving them to secondary regulation.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe draft amendments to the Competition Protection Act represent a substantively positive step toward EU harmonization under Chapter 8 (Competition Policy) and indirectly support Chapter 23 objectives by strengthening institutional independence and the rule of law. However, from a justice perspective, the law must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that expanded investigative powers include robust procedural safeguards, that the fining regime respects constitutional proportionality principles, and that judicial review mechanisms are adequate to prevent arbitrary enforcement.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- Absence of explicit procedural safeguards (legal privilege, right to be heard, privilege against self-incrimination) commensurate with expanded investigative powers\\n- Risk that judicial review via the Administrative Court may not meet the 'full jurisdiction' standard required by ECtHR case law (Menarini) for quasi-criminal administrative fines\\n- Insufficient detail on appointment, dismissal, and accountability mechanisms for Agency leadership, risking political capture\\n- No visible inter-agency cooperation framework with ASK and SDT to leverage competition enforcement for anti-corruption outcomes\\n- Potential gap between transposing EU enforcement powers and transposing corresponding EU procedural rights under the Charter of Fundamental Rights\\n- Need to ensure a genuine public consultation process consistent with regulatory impact assessment requirements\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Insert explicit provisions guaranteeing the right to legal professional privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the right to be heard before any adverse finding, directly mirroring Articles 47-48 of the EU Charter\\n- Amend the judicial review provisions to ensure the Administrative Court exercises full merits review over competition fines, or establish a specialized judicial panel with competition law expertise\\n- Include transparent, merit-based appointment procedures for Agency leadership with fixed terms, removal only for cause, and parliamentary oversight — modeled on ECN+ Directive requirements\\n- Establish a formal memorandum of cooperation between the Competition Agency, ASK, and SDT for cases involving bid-rigging and corruption in public procurement\\n- Mandate a regulatory impact assessment and minimum 30-day public consultation period before parliamentary submission, with published responses to stakeholder comments\\n- Introduce graduated sanctioning guidelines to ensure proportionality in fines, including mitigating factors, leniency programs, and settlement procedures aligned with EU practice\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Procedural Safeguards and Judicial Review Enhancement Package**\\nThe Ministry of Justice would supplement the draft law with a dedicated chapter on procedural rights of investigated undertakings and a parallel amendment to the Law on Administrative Disputes to ensure full merits judicial review of competition decisions. This would be accompanied by a formalized inter-agency cooperation protocol and a mandatory leniency and settlement framework.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a dedicated chapter (Part IV-A) on 'Rights of Undertakings in Competition Proceedings' codifying legal privilege, right to be heard, access to file, and privilege against self-incrimination\\n- Amend Article 18 of the Law on Administrative Disputes to grant the Administrative Court full jurisdiction (facts and law) over competition fine appeals, or create a specialized competition chamber\\n- Introduce statutory criteria for Agency leadership appointments: public vacancy notice, selection committee with judicial representation, fixed 5-year renewable term, removal only by qualified parliamentary majority for cause\\n- Adopt a formal leniency program and settlement procedure regulation as a mandatory annex to the law, rather than leaving it to Agency discretion\\n- Require inter-agency cooperation agreements with ASK and SDT within 6 months of entry into force\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Health\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This competition law reform is positive for health policy because it creates stronger tools to combat pharmaceutical price-fixing and procurement collusion that burden Montenegro's constrained healthcare budget. The key concern is whether the Competition Protection Agency will have the expertise and mandate to prioritize health markets. The Ministry recommends establishing a formal cooperation protocol between the Agency and health institutions.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe strengthening of Montenegro's Competition Protection Agency is a welcome development from a public health perspective. While not a health-sector law per se, robust competition enforcement has direct implications for pharmaceutical pricing, hospital procurement, and healthcare service markets. Enhanced agency powers aligned with EU standards can help combat anticompetitive practices that inflate healthcare costs for the RFZO health insurance fund and ultimately for patients. The Ministry of Health views this as a structurally positive reform, though it requires deliberate health-sector application to realize its potential.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The Competition Protection Agency may lack sector-specific expertise in pharmaceutical markets, medical device procurement, and health service competition, reducing the law's practical impact on healthcare\\n- No formal cooperation mechanism appears to be established between the Agency and the Ministry of Health, RFZO, or the Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (CALIMS), risking siloed enforcement\\n- Montenegro's small market size means many health-sector suppliers hold de facto dominant positions; the law must be applied with an understanding of natural monopoly dynamics in small-state healthcare\\n- The law does not appear to specifically address parallel trade restrictions or excessive pricing of off-patent medicines—issues highly relevant to Montenegro's pharmaceutical access challenges\\n- Enforcement capacity is uncertain: even with expanded powers, the Agency will need trained staff capable of analyzing complex pharmaceutical market structures and pricing data\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a formal Memorandum of Understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Ministry of Health, RFZO, and CALIMS to facilitate information sharing and joint market monitoring in pharmaceutical and medical device sectors\\n- Request that the Agency conduct a pharmaceutical sector inquiry modeled on the European Commission's 2009 study, examining wholesale distribution concentration, generic entry barriers, and public procurement patterns in Montenegro\\n- Ensure that RFZO procurement data is made available to the Agency in structured format to enable detection of bid-rigging patterns in medical supplies and equipment tenders\\n- Advocate for the inclusion of at least one health-sector specialist within the Agency's staff or advisory board to ensure competent assessment of healthcare competition cases\\n- Use the EU accession negotiation framework (Chapters 8 and 28) to link competition enforcement in health markets to Montenegro's benchmarking commitments, creating institutional accountability\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Health Market Competition Protocol**\\nThe Ministry of Health would complement the new Competition Protection Law with a sector-specific protocol for health market oversight. Rather than relying solely on the general competition framework, this protocol would create structured cooperation between health institutions and the Competition Agency, mandate periodic pharmaceutical market reviews, and integrate competition screening into RFZO procurement processes.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Adopt a joint Ministry of Health–Competition Agency cooperation agreement with defined roles, data-sharing obligations, and annual joint work planning for health market monitoring\\n- Mandate biennial pharmaceutical market competition reviews covering wholesale distribution, generic penetration rates, and tender pricing trends, with findings reported to the Government and published\\n- Integrate competition compliance screening into all RFZO and public hospital procurement processes above €50,000, using red-flag indicators for bid-rigging developed with Agency guidance\\n- Establish a health-sector competition complaints mechanism accessible to pharmacies, hospitals, and patient organizations to report suspected anticompetitive conduct\\n- Include health market case studies in the Agency's annual capacity-building program, potentially through EU technical assistance under IPA III funding\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Finance\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This is a well-directed reform that supports EU accession and market competitiveness, earning a positive assessment. The Ministry's primary concerns are ensuring the Agency's expanded mandate is funded sustainably without creating open-ended budget obligations, and that fine revenues flow transparently through the consolidated treasury. We recommend linking the Agency's operational budget to a capped formula rather than granting unchecked financial independence.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe draft amendments to the Competition Protection Act represent a fiscally sound and strategically important step toward EU accession. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's independence and enforcement powers aligns Montenegro with Chapter 8 (Competition Policy) benchmarks, which is critical for the EU negotiation process. While the direct budget impact is modest, the law has meaningful indirect fiscal implications through improved market efficiency, potential fine revenues, and enhanced foreign investor confidence. However, the Ministry of Finance has concerns about the Agency's funding model, the fiscal treatment of collected fines, and the need to ensure enforcement capacity matches the expanded legal mandate.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The Agency's 'financial independence' must not bypass consolidated treasury controls or escape parliamentary budget oversight — this creates fiscal governance risk\\n- No published fiscal impact assessment accompanies the draft law, which is required under Montenegro's budgetary legislation before adoption\\n- Fine revenues (potentially significant at up to 10% of global turnover) must flow into the central budget and not be earmarked for the Agency to avoid creating perverse enforcement incentives\\n- Risk of an unfunded mandate: expanded legal powers without adequate budget for staff, training, economic analysts, and IT infrastructure will render the reform cosmetic\\n- Potential short-term compliance costs for businesses may temporarily reduce corporate tax revenues as firms invest in compliance rather than expansion\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Require the Ministry of Economic Development to submit a full fiscal impact assessment before the draft proceeds to Government session, quantifying the Agency's multi-year funding needs\\n- Amend the draft to explicitly require that all fine revenues are deposited into the single treasury account managed by the Ministry of Finance, with no earmarking for the Agency\\n- Cap the Agency's annual budget at a defined formula (e.g., fixed base plus inflation adjustment) subject to annual approval in the Budget Law, rather than granting open-ended financial autonomy\\n- Allocate transitional EU pre-accession (IPA III) funds for capacity building at the Agency — staff training, economic analysis tools, and cooperation frameworks with DG Competition\\n- Coordinate with the Tax Administration to develop information-sharing protocols so that competition investigations can leverage existing tax data on company revenues and market positions\\n- Establish a joint Ministry of Finance–Agency working group to monitor the fiscal effects of major enforcement actions and ensure coherence with broader economic policy\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Fiscally Disciplined Competition Reform with Treasury Integration**\\nThe Ministry of Finance supports the reform's objectives but would amend the draft to embed stronger fiscal governance safeguards. Rather than granting blanket financial independence, we would establish a transparent, formula-based funding model for the Agency within the annual Budget Law, require all fine revenues to flow through the consolidated treasury, mandate a fiscal impact assessment before adoption, and create a phased capacity-building plan co-financed by IPA III funds. This ensures EU alignment without creating a new fiscally autonomous entity outside standard public finance controls.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Replace 'financial independence' language with 'operational independence with budgetary accountability' — the Agency's budget remains within the consolidated state budget approved by Parliament\\n- Add an explicit provision requiring all collected fines to be deposited into the central treasury account\\n- Mandate a published fiscal impact assessment as a precondition for parliamentary consideration\\n- Introduce a three-year phased implementation plan with defined budget envelopes (estimated EUR 1.5-2.5 million annually for the expanded mandate)\\n- Require annual reporting by the Agency to the Ministry of Finance on enforcement outcomes, costs, and fine collection\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Economy\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This is a broadly positive decision that aligns Montenegro's competition framework with EU acquis Chapter 8 requirements and signals regulatory maturity to foreign investors. The Ministry of Economy's primary concerns are ensuring proportionate enforcement that does not disproportionately burden SMEs, and guaranteeing that the Agency's expanded mandate is matched by real institutional capacity. We recommend complementary measures including SME compliance support programs and sector-specific competition assessments in energy and tourism.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe draft amendments to the Competition Protection Act represent a meaningful step toward EU regulatory alignment and a more level playing field for businesses operating in Montenegro. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's independence and enforcement capacity should improve market dynamics, attract quality FDI, and support SME competitiveness. However, the law's ultimate impact depends critically on implementation capacity, proportionality safeguards for smaller firms, and whether the Agency receives adequate staffing and budgetary resources to exercise its new powers effectively.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The Competition Protection Agency's current staffing and budget levels may be insufficient to exercise expanded investigative and enforcement powers effectively\\n- The 10% global revenue fine ceiling, while EU-standard, lacks clear proportionality guidance for SMEs and micro-enterprises that dominate Montenegro's business landscape\\n- Risk of selective or politically influenced enforcement given Montenegro's governance challenges and the intertwining of business and political interests\\n- No indication of transitional provisions or compliance grace periods for businesses to adapt to the new regime\\n- Operational and financial independence of the Agency must be guaranteed in practice, not just in statute — appointment procedures, budget autonomy, and protection from political interference need explicit safeguards\\n- The law's effectiveness depends on judicial capacity to handle competition cases, which remains underdeveloped in Montenegro's court system\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a dedicated SME competition compliance support program, including guidelines in Montenegrin language, free advisory services, and clear safe harbors for firms below defined turnover thresholds\\n- Ensure the Agency's budget and staffing plan is included as an integral part of the legislative package, with a binding commitment to increase staff to at least 50 professionals within 24 months\\n- Introduce explicit proportionality criteria for fines that account for firm size, turnover, and the nature of the infringement — mirroring EU practice but adapted to Montenegro's economic scale\\n- Conduct sector-specific competition assessments in energy, telecommunications, and tourism within 12 months of the law's adoption to establish enforcement priorities\\n- Develop a judicial training program on competition law for the Administrative Court and Commercial Court judges who will handle appeals\\n- Include whistleblower protections and a leniency program for cartel cases, aligned with the EU's ECN+ Directive requirements, to improve detection capacity\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Competition Law Plus: Enforcement Capacity and SME Protection Package**\\nThe Ministry of Economy would retain the core legislative reforms but embed them within a broader institutional strengthening package. Rather than passing the law in isolation, we would bundle it with a binding Agency capacity-building plan, an SME compliance support program, and mandatory sector inquiries in the three most concentrated markets. This approach ensures the law delivers real market impact rather than remaining a paper reform for EU accession purposes.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Attach a binding three-year Agency staffing and budget plan to the legislative package, requiring Parliamentary approval alongside the law itself\\n- Introduce an SME safe harbor: firms below €2 million annual turnover would benefit from simplified procedures, reduced maximum fines, and access to free compliance guidance before any enforcement action\\n- Mandate competition sector inquiries in energy, telecommunications, and retail within 12 months, with published findings and remedial recommendations\\n- Establish a leniency and whistleblower framework as part of the same legislative package rather than deferring it to secondary legislation\\n- Create a Competition Advocacy Unit within the Agency tasked with reviewing new legislation and public procurement practices for anti-competitive effects\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of EU Integration\\n**Verdict**: strongly_positive (9/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: The draft Competition Protection Law is a strongly positive step for EU accession, directly addressing opening and interim benchmarks under Chapter 8 and aligning Montenegro's competition regime with the EU acquis. The Ministry of EU Integration's primary concern is ensuring genuine operational independence of the Agency and adequate institutional capacity to exercise these new powers — legislative alignment without implementation credibility will not satisfy the European Commission.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThis draft law represents one of the most strategically significant legislative moves Montenegro can make at this stage of the accession process. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's independence and enforcement powers, while aligning the fining regime with the EU's 10% global turnover threshold, directly addresses long-standing European Commission benchmarks under Chapter 8 (Competition Policy). If implemented faithfully, this legislation could help advance Montenegro's position on one of the more technically demanding negotiation chapters and send a strong signal to Brussels that the country is serious about rule-of-law-adjacent economic reforms.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- De facto independence of the Agency remains uncertain — legislative provisions must be accompanied by safeguards against political appointments and informal government interference in case selection\\n- Institutional capacity is a major risk: the Agency currently has limited staff and expertise, and expanded powers without corresponding human and financial resources will produce a law that exists on paper only\\n- The law must include robust procedural safeguards (right to be heard, judicial review, legal professional privilege) to meet EU due process standards — otherwise the Commission will flag rule-of-law deficiencies\\n- Alignment with state aid provisions under the same Chapter 8 framework should be verified — competition and state aid enforcement need to advance in parallel\\n- The enforcement track record is what the Commission ultimately evaluates; the law must be followed by actual high-profile investigations and decisions to demonstrate credibility\\n- Public consultation and parliamentary debate process must meet EU Better Regulation standards — rushed adoption without meaningful stakeholder input would undermine the reform's credibility\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Ensure the draft law explicitly codifies the Agency's budgetary independence, including a dedicated funding mechanism not subject to annual government discretionary allocation\\n- Introduce a transparent, merit-based appointment procedure for Agency leadership, ideally involving an open competition and parliamentary confirmation with qualified majority\\n- Pair the legislative reform with a multi-year institutional strengthening plan, including EU-funded training programmes (potentially through IPA III or TAIEX/twinning instruments) to build investigative and economic analysis capacity\\n- Include leniency programme provisions aligned with the EU's model to incentivize cartel detection — this is a specific Commission expectation under Chapter 8\\n- Coordinate with the Ministry of Finance to ensure parallel progress on state aid control, as the Commission assesses both domains together under Chapter 8\\n- Submit the draft to the European Commission for informal technical review before parliamentary adoption, leveraging the SAA (Stabilisation and Association Agreement) subcommittee on internal market and competition\\n- Develop a 2-3 year enforcement action plan with measurable targets (number of investigations opened, decisions adopted, fines imposed) to demonstrate implementation credibility in the 2027 progress report cycle\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Comprehensive Chapter 8 Reform Package with Implementation Roadmap**\\nRather than advancing the competition law amendment as a standalone legislative act, the Ministry of EU Integration would propose embedding it within a comprehensive Chapter 8 reform package that simultaneously addresses antitrust, state aid control, and merger review, accompanied by a binding implementation roadmap with milestones, an institutional capacity-building plan funded through IPA III, and a formal pre-screening by the European Commission before parliamentary adoption.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Bundle the competition law amendment with parallel state aid law reform to present a unified Chapter 8 package to the European Commission\\n- Add a legally binding implementation roadmap annex with quarterly milestones for Agency staffing, training, and first enforcement actions\\n- Formally request a TAIEX peer review mission from an EU Member State competition authority (e.g., Croatia's AZTN) to validate the draft before adoption\\n- Include explicit leniency and settlement procedure provisions aligned with the EU Competition Network (ECN+) Directive 2019/1\\n- Establish a parliamentary oversight mechanism for Agency performance reporting, increasing accountability without compromising case-level independence\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Tourism\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This competition law reform is broadly positive for tourism, as it provides a credible enforcement mechanism against market concentration and anticompetitive practices that have long distorted Montenegro's coastal and hospitality sectors. The Ministry's primary concern is that tourism-specific market dynamics — particularly seasonal pricing, concession monopolies, and cruise port agreements — are not explicitly addressed, risking under-enforcement in the sector. We recommend the Agency establish a dedicated tourism market monitoring unit and prioritize investigations into coastal concession allocation and Kotor cruise traffic agreements.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe strengthening of Montenegro's Competition Protection Agency and alignment with EU competition standards is a positive development for the tourism sector. While not a tourism-specific law, robust competition enforcement directly addresses several structural distortions in Montenegro's tourism market — from oligopolistic control of coastal hospitality and marina concessions to anticompetitive pricing practices during peak season. This law creates an institutional framework that can improve market fairness, consumer protection, and service quality across the tourism value chain.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The law does not include tourism-specific provisions or guidance on seasonal market dynamics, risking under-enforcement of anticompetitive practices unique to the sector\\n- The Competition Protection Agency currently lacks sector-specific expertise in tourism markets, cruise shipping, and concession economics\\n- Beach and coastal concession allocation — a major source of competition distortion — operates under separate municipal frameworks that may fall outside the Agency's practical reach\\n- Cruise port access agreements in Kotor have competition and UNESCO carrying capacity implications that require specialized oversight\\n- Implementation timeline is unclear — Montenegro's tourism sector needs enforcement capacity before the 2026 summer season to address existing distortions\\n- Dominant online travel platforms (Booking.com, Airbnb) operate from EU jurisdictions, complicating enforcement of competition rules against their market practices in Montenegro\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a dedicated tourism and hospitality market monitoring unit within the Competition Protection Agency, staffed with analysts who understand seasonal pricing, concession economics, and platform markets\\n- Prioritize a sector inquiry into coastal beach concession allocation across Budva, Kotor, Herceg Novi, and Ulcinj municipalities to identify anticompetitive patterns and recommend structural reforms\\n- Issue sector-specific guidance on what constitutes anticompetitive coordination in seasonal tourism markets, distinguishing legitimate supply-demand pricing from cartel behaviour\\n- Investigate the competitive structure of Kotor cruise port access, including whether current arrangements between port authorities and cruise lines restrict market entry or inflate costs\\n- Coordinate with the Ministry of Tourism to ensure that competition enforcement supports the National Tourism Development Strategy, particularly goals around diversification, sustainability, and quality improvement\\n- Engage with EU DG Competition to access technical assistance and training specifically tailored to tourism market competition, leveraging Montenegro's EU accession process\\n- Ensure the law's enforcement mechanisms can reach platform-mediated markets, including addressing most-favoured-nation clauses imposed by OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) on Montenegrin accommodation providers\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Tourism-Integrated Competition Enforcement Framework**\\nThe Ministry of Tourism would supplement the general competition law with a sector-specific protocol for tourism market oversight. This would include a formal memorandum of understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism, establishing joint monitoring of key tourism sub-markets (coastal concessions, cruise port access, accommodation platforms, and national park service concessions), with mandatory annual sector inquiries and published competition health reports for the tourism industry.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Mandate a formal cooperation agreement between the Competition Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism for joint tourism market monitoring\\n- Require annual competition sector inquiries covering beach concessions, cruise port agreements, and accommodation platform practices, with public reporting\\n- Introduce tourism-specific block exemption guidelines clarifying when cooperative arrangements among small tourism operators (e.g., joint marketing by agritourism providers) are permissible\\n- Establish a fast-track complaint mechanism for tourism SMEs experiencing anticompetitive practices, with expedited review during the May-October season\\n- Include explicit provisions for investigating platform market power in the accommodation sector, covering parity clauses and commission structures\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n## Parliamentary Debate\\n**Overall Verdict**: neutral\\n\\n### Consensus\\nDebate could not be fully parsed.\\n\\n### Debate Transcript\\nNo debate generated.\\n\\n## Independent Critic Report\\n\\nThis is a genuinely good decision — one of those rare cases where the government is doing something that substantively matters for EU accession rather than performing reform theatre. Aligning Montenegro's competition framework with the ECN+ Directive and Regulation 1/2003 standards is a hard requirement for Chapter 8, and the fact that this law addresses the Commission's three perennial complaints (weak powers, low fines, insufficient independence) suggests someone actually read the progress reports.\\n\\nHowever, the decision deserves an 8, not a 10, because the devil is in implementation. Montenegro has a well-earned reputation for adopting beautiful legislation and then starving the implementing institutions of resources. The Competition Protection Agency reportedly operates with fewer than 30 staff — a skeleton crew that cannot credibly exercise dawn raid powers, conduct complex economic analysis of market dominance, or prosecute cartel cases against firms with teams of lawyers. If this law passes without a binding commitment to triple the Agency's budget and headcount, it will be Chapter 8 window-dressing.\\n\\nThe ministry assessments are collectively decent but exhibit a predictable pattern: each ministry competently analyzed the decision through its own narrow lens, but nobody stepped back to ask the hard structural questions. The Ministry of Justice produced the most substantively valuable assessment, correctly flagging the Menarini full-jurisdiction requirement and the need for procedural safeguards equivalent to Articles 47-48 of the EU Charter. The Ministry of EU Integration gave the highest score (9/10) but reads like cheerleading — it correctly identifies the strategic importance but glosses over the implementation risk that has torpedoed similar reforms before. A 9/10 for a draft law that hasn't been tested in practice is premature optimism.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Finance raised the important point about fine revenues flowing through the treasury (not being earmarked for the Agency), which is correct governance practice but creates a perverse dynamic: the Agency generates revenue it cannot keep, reducing its incentive to enforce aggressively while the Finance Ministry has an incentive to underfund it.\\n\\nCritically, NO ministry examined the state aid control dimension. Chapter 8 is not just antitrust — it encompasses state aid, and Montenegro's state aid enforcement is arguably even weaker than its antitrust enforcement. EPCG, Montenegro Airlines' successor entities, and various tourism development subsidies all raise state aid questions that the Commission watches closely. A law that strengthens antitrust but ignores state aid reform addresses only half the chapter.\\n\\nThe assessments also collectively failed to examine the Agency's actual track record. How many cartel cases has it brought? How many abuse of dominance findings? What fines have been imposed and collected? Without this baseline, the discussion of 'expanded powers' floats in an empirical vacuum. A cynic might note that the government is more comfortable announcing new powers than actually using existing ones.\\n\\nFrom an EU perspective, this law will be received positively in Brussels but with calibrated expectations. The Commission has seen this movie before — not just in Montenegro but across the Western Balkans. The 2026 country report will likely note the legislative progress approvingly while adding the standard caveat about the need for 'a credible enforcement track record.' The real test comes 12-18 months after adoption: will the Agency bring a single case against a politically connected firm? That will tell us whether this is reform or performance.\\n\\nOne genuinely concerning blind spot: no ministry discussed the leniency programme. In the EU, the vast majority of cartel cases are initiated through leniency applications — companies coming forward to report cartels in exchange for immunity or reduced fines. In a small economy like Montenegro's, where business elites are interconnected and retaliation risks are high, a well-designed leniency programme with strong confidentiality protections is essential. Without it, the 10% fine ceiling is a paper tiger — you cannot impose fines on cartels you cannot detect.\\n\\nThe decision is directionally correct, strategically important, and substantively aligned with EU requirements. It deserves credit. But the gap between legislative ambition and institutional reality in Montenegro remains the fundamental risk, and the ministry assessments were too polite to say so bluntly enough.\\n\\n### Blind Spots\\n- No ministry addressed the state aid control dimension — Chapter 8 covers both antitrust AND state aid, and Montenegro's state aid framework is equally weak. Strengthening one without the other creates an asymmetric enforcement regime that the Commission will flag.\\n- Nobody examined the leniency programme design — a credible cartel enforcement regime depends on a well-designed leniency/immunity programme to incentivize whistleblowing. Without this, even strong fines won't break cartels in Montenegro's small, relationship-driven economy.\\n- No ministry questioned WHO drafted the law and whether incumbent dominant firms (e.g., EPCG, Crnogorski Telekom) or their lobbyists had influence over the drafting process, potentially inserting loopholes or exemptions.\\n- The merger control threshold reform was not discussed — Montenegro's current notification thresholds may be poorly calibrated for its small economy, and the amendments' treatment of merger review is unexamined.\\n- No ministry addressed the interaction with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) competition provisions, which already impose EU-equivalent competition obligations on Montenegro.\\n- The digital markets dimension is entirely absent — no ministry considered how this law applies to platform competition (Google, Meta, Apple ecosystems), which is increasingly central to EU competition policy (DMA).\\n- No assessment examined the Agency's actual enforcement track record — how many cases has it opened, how many fines imposed, and what was the outcome? Without this baseline, claims about 'strengthened powers' are meaningless.\\n- Settlement and commitment procedures — essential tools in EU competition enforcement that reduce caseload — were not discussed by any ministry.\\n- The risk of regulatory arbitrage within the Western Balkans (firms structuring operations to avoid Montenegrin jurisdiction) was not considered.\\n\\n## AI Government Counter-proposal\\n### Comprehensive Chapter 8 Reform Package with Procedural Safeguards, Fiscal Discipline, and Cross-Sectoral Enforcement Architecture\\n\\n**The AI Government of Montenegro would transform the standalone Competition Protection Law amendment into a comprehensive Chapter 8 reform package that bundles antitrust enforcement with state aid alignment, embeds robust procedural safeguards for investigated undertakings, maintains fiscal discipline through treasury-integrated Agency funding, and establishes a structured cross-sectoral enforcement architecture prioritizing Montenegro's most concentrated markets — energy, telecommunications, tourism, pharmaceuticals, and waste management. This approach maximizes EU accession impact while ensuring the law delivers real market outcomes rather than remaining a paper reform.**\\n\\nThe draft Competition Protection Law is a strategically sound initiative that addresses longstanding European Commission criticisms of Montenegro's Chapter 8 readiness. The AI Government endorses its core objectives — expanded investigative powers, dissuasive fines aligned with EU Regulation 1/2003, and strengthened Agency independence. However, we would significantly enhance the draft across five dimensions to ensure it achieves both EU alignment credibility and domestic market impact.\\n\\n**1. From Standalone Law to Comprehensive Chapter 8 Package**\\n\\nThe most important structural change is to embed the competition law amendment within a unified Chapter 8 reform package. The European Commission assesses antitrust, state aid control, and merger review together; advancing only one pillar while the others lag creates an unbalanced negotiating position. The legislative package should therefore include parallel state aid law reforms and explicitly reference coherence with merger review procedures. Before parliamentary adoption, the package should be submitted to the European Commission for informal technical screening via the SAA subcommittee on internal market and competition, and a TAIEX peer review mission from an experienced EU competition authority (Croatia's AZTN is the natural partner) should validate the draft. This maximizes the probability of a positive assessment in the October 2026 country report.\\n\\n**2. Procedural Rights and Judicial Review — The Rule of Law Foundation**\\n\\nThe draft law's expansion of investigative powers — dawn raids, compelled document production, digital forensics — must be matched by an equally robust procedural rights framework. Without this, the law risks ECtHR challenges and European Commission criticism under Chapter 23 (rule of law). A dedicated chapter on 'Rights of Undertakings in Competition Proceedings' should codify: legal professional privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination (per ECtHR Saunders v. UK), the right to be heard before any adverse finding, and full access to the investigative file. Critically, the judicial review mechanism must be upgraded. The current Administrative Court review may not satisfy the 'full jurisdiction' standard established in Menarini Diagnostics v. Italy for quasi-criminal administrative fines. We propose either amending the Law on Administrative Disputes to grant the Administrative Court full merits review over competition decisions, or establishing a specialized competition chamber with judges trained in economic analysis. This dual reform — strong powers with strong safeguards — is what the EU expects and what credible enforcement requires.\\n\\n**3. Agency Independence with Fiscal Accountability**\\n\\nThe tension between genuine operational independence (essential for EU credibility) and fiscal discipline (essential for public finance governance) must be resolved carefully. We propose the formula: 'operational independence with budgetary accountability.' The Agency's case selection, investigative decisions, and enforcement actions must be fully insulated from political interference — this is non-negotiable for the European Commission. However, the Agency's budget should remain within the consolidated state budget, subject to annual parliamentary approval and State Audit Institution (DRI) review, rather than creating an unconstrained fiscally autonomous entity. A formula-based funding model — a defined base plus inflation adjustment, with a binding three-year budget envelope of approximately EUR 1.5–2.5 million annually for the expanded mandate — provides predictability without fiscal free-rein. All collected fines must be deposited into the central treasury account with no earmarking for the Agency, preventing perverse enforcement incentives. Agency leadership must be appointed through a transparent, merit-based process: public vacancy notice, selection committee with judicial representation, fixed five-year renewable terms, and removal only by qualified parliamentary majority for cause.\\n\\n**4. Institutional Capacity — Making the Law Real**\\n\\nMontenegro's persistent failure mode is adopting EU-aligned laws without building institutional capacity to implement them. This must not be repeated. A binding three-year staffing plan should be attached as an annex to the legislative package, requiring the Agency to reach at least 50 qualified professionals within 24 months. The plan should be co-financed through IPA III funds, with TAIEX and twinning instruments supporting training in economic analysis, digital forensics, and sector-specific enforcement. A structured leniency programme and settlement procedure — aligned with the ECN+ Directive 2019/1 — must be included in the primary legislation, not deferred to secondary regulation. These tools are force multipliers that allow a small agency to detect cartels it could never uncover through investigations alone. A Competition Advocacy Unit should be established within the Agency, tasked with reviewing new legislation and public procurement practices for anti-competitive effects — shifting the Agency from purely reactive enforcement to proactive market improvement.\\n\\n**5. Cross-Sectoral Enforcement Architecture**\\n\\nMultiple ministries have identified sector-specific competition concerns — in healthcare, tourism, waste management, energy, and labour markets. Each has proposed bilateral MoUs with the Agency. Rather than creating a fragmented web of bilateral agreements that could overwhelm a 50-person agency, we propose a structured Sectoral Enforcement Framework with three tiers:\\n\\n*Tier 1 — Mandatory Sector Inquiries (within 12–18 months):* Energy and telecommunications (highest concentration, greatest consumer impact), pharmaceutical procurement (RFZO cost implications), and coastal tourism concessions (GDP significance and documented distortions). These are the priority sectors where enforcement can deliver visible results quickly.\\n\\n*Tier 2 — Inter-Agency Cooperation Protocols:* A single, unified inter-agency cooperation framework — rather than separate bilateral MoUs — connecting the Competition Agency with: the Police Directorate and Special State Prosecutor (for cases revealing criminal conduct such as bid-rigging), the Ministry of Health and RFZO (for pharmaceutical market monitoring), the Ministry of Tourism (for seasonal market and concession oversight), the Environmental Protection Agency (for waste management and energy transition cases), and the Agency for Prevention of Corruption. This framework should include a mandatory referral clause: when competition investigations reveal indicators of criminal conduct, the Agency must notify the SDT. A joint analytical capability with the Police Directorate's economic crime unit should be piloted within 12 months.\\n\\n*Tier 3 — Progressive Integration (24–36 months):* Sustainability considerations in merger reviews for environmentally sensitive sectors, labour market competition violations (employer wage-fixing, no-poach clauses) aligned with evolving EU/OECD practice, and tourism platform market power (OTA parity clauses and commission structures). These represent emerging enforcement frontiers that should be built toward as Agency capacity matures.\\n\\n**6. SME Proportionality Safeguards**\\n\\nMontenegro's 30,000+ SMEs and micro-enterprises cannot be treated identically to dominant market players. A proportionality framework should include: simplified procedures and reduced maximum fines for firms below EUR 2 million annual turnover, graduated sanctioning guidelines with mitigating factors for all firms, compliance assistance (guidelines in Montenegrin, free advisory services) before enforcement action against smaller operators, and phased fine payment or remedial compliance plans as alternatives to immediate full fines for firms that are significant local employers. This protects small businesses while maintaining full enforcement vigour against dominant firms and cartels.\\n\\n**7. Social Dialogue and Impact Assessment**\\n\\nThe draft law should undergo genuine public consultation — minimum 30 days with published responses to stakeholder comments — before parliamentary submission. The Social Council (Socijalni savjet) should be formally consulted, consistent with Montenegro's ILO Convention No. 144 obligations. A mandatory fiscal impact assessment must be completed before parliamentary consideration. For major enforcement actions (fines exceeding 2% of domestic revenue), the Agency should be required to assess potential labour market impacts and notify the Employment Bureau when significant workforce reductions may result, enabling proactive activation of retraining and labour market support measures.\\n\\nThis comprehensive approach transforms a good but narrow legislative initiative into a reform package that simultaneously advances Chapters 8, 23, 24, and 19 of Montenegro's EU accession negotiations, delivers tangible market improvements for consumers and businesses, and builds durable institutional capacity.\\n\\n### Key Differences\\n- Transforms a standalone competition law amendment into a comprehensive Chapter 8 package bundling antitrust, state aid, and merger review reforms — maximizing EU accession impact\\n- Adds a dedicated procedural rights chapter for investigated undertakings (legal privilege, self-incrimination protection, right to be heard, file access) that the original draft appears to lack\\n- Upgrades judicial review to full merits standard (facts and law) rather than limited legality review, addressing ECtHR Menarini requirements\\n- Replaces blanket 'financial independence' with 'operational independence with budgetary accountability' — Agency decisions are independent but budget remains in consolidated treasury with parliamentary oversight\\n- Introduces SME proportionality safeguards (safe harbor below EUR 2M turnover, graduated sanctions, compliance assistance) absent from the original draft\\n- Mandates sector-specific enforcement priorities (energy, telecoms, pharma, tourism concessions) rather than leaving enforcement agenda entirely to Agency discretion\\n- Includes a leniency programme and settlement procedures in primary legislation rather than deferring to secondary regulation\\n- Creates a unified inter-agency cooperation framework connecting competition enforcement with criminal justice (SDT, Police), health (RFZO, CALIMS), environment (EPA), and labour (Employment Bureau) institutions\\n- Requires labour market impact assessment for major enforcement actions and expands anti-competitive practices to cover employer wage-fixing and no-poach agreements\\n- Conditions parliamentary adoption on a binding three-year Agency staffing and budget plan, TAIEX peer review, and completed fiscal impact assessment\\n\\n### Implementation Steps\\n1. Month 1–2: Ministry of Economic Development submits draft to European Commission via SAA subcommittee for informal technical screening; simultaneously requests TAIEX peer review mission from Croatia's AZTN\\n1. Month 2–3: Ministry of Justice drafts procedural safeguards chapter and judicial review amendments to Law on Administrative Disputes; Ministry of Finance completes mandatory fiscal impact assessment and three-year budget envelope\\n1. Month 3–4: Public consultation period (minimum 30 days) with Social Council formal consultation; incorporate stakeholder feedback and Commission/TAIEX recommendations into revised draft\\n1. Month 4–5: Government session adopts comprehensive Chapter 8 legislative package (competition law + state aid alignment + binding staffing/budget annex); submission to Parliament\\n1. Month 5–8: Parliamentary debate and adoption; simultaneous preparation of secondary legislation (leniency programme rules, sanctioning guidelines, inter-agency cooperation framework decree)\\n1. Month 6–9: Agency leadership appointment through new merit-based procedure (public vacancy, selection committee with judicial representation, parliamentary confirmation)\\n1. Month 9–12: Agency begins institutional build-up — recruitment toward 50-person target, IPA III-funded training programme launch, IT systems procurement for digital forensics and case management\\n1. Month 9–12: Unified inter-agency cooperation framework signed (single agreement covering SDT, Police Directorate, RFZO/CALIMS, EPA, Employment Bureau, ASK); pilot joint analytical unit with Police Directorate economic crime division\\n1. Month 12–18: First mandatory sector inquiries launched in energy/telecommunications, pharmaceutical procurement, and coastal tourism concessions; Competition Advocacy Unit begins reviewing existing legislation for anti-competitive effects\\n1. Month 18–24: Agency reaches full operational capacity (50+ staff); first enforcement decisions under new framework; published findings from sector inquiries with remedial recommendations\\n1. Month 24–36: Progressive integration of Tier 3 priorities — sustainability screening in merger reviews, labour market competition enforcement (wage-fixing/no-poach), platform market power investigations\\n1. Ongoing (annually): Agency reports to Parliament on enforcement outcomes, costs, and fine collection; Ministry of Finance monitors fiscal effects; progress assessed against Chapter 8 closing benchmarks\\n\\n### Risks & Tradeoffs\\n- Comprehensiveness vs. speed: Bundling competition law with state aid reform and institutional capacity requirements delays adoption compared to the standalone draft. Mitigation: The delay (estimated 2–3 months) is justified by significantly stronger EU assessment outcomes and reduced risk of a paper-only reform that the Commission dismisses.\\n- Agency capacity overload: The unified inter-agency framework and mandatory sector inquiries place significant demands on a small agency still building capacity. Mitigation: The three-tier prioritization structure sequences demands — Tier 1 mandatory inquiries start immediately, Tier 3 items wait 24–36 months. The 50-person staffing target and IPA III training are explicitly designed to match ambition to capacity.\\n- Fiscal cost: The EUR 1.5–2.5 million annual Agency budget increase is real spending in a constrained fiscal environment. Mitigation: This is approximately 0.1% of Montenegro's consolidated budget and is partially offset by fine revenues flowing to the treasury, improved market efficiency, and stronger IPA III fund absorption. The cost of NOT having credible competition enforcement — in delayed accession, lost FDI confidence, and consumer harm — far exceeds this investment.\\n- SME safe harbor may be exploited: Firms could structure operations to stay below the EUR 2M threshold. Mitigation: The safe harbor provides simplified procedures and reduced penalties, not immunity. Cartel participation by any firm remains fully prosecutable regardless of size.\\n- Political resistance to genuine Agency independence: Montenegro's governance culture includes informal influence over regulatory bodies. Mitigation: The merit-based appointment process with parliamentary confirmation and removal-only-for-cause protections creates structural barriers; EU monitoring and the annual progress report cycle provide external accountability pressure.\\n- Judicial capacity gap: Full merits review of complex competition cases requires economic expertise that the Administrative Court currently lacks. Mitigation: A specialized competition chamber or designated judges, combined with EU-funded judicial training, can be established within the 12–18 month implementation window. This aligns with ongoing Chapter 23 judicial reform.\\n- Inter-agency cooperation may encounter institutional resistance: Information-sharing between competition, police, and sectoral regulators faces cultural and legal barriers. Mitigation: The phased approach — starting with a pilot joint analytical unit and a single framework agreement — builds trust incrementally. EU member state models (Netherlands, Germany) provide proven templates.\\n- Mandatory labour impact assessments could slow enforcement: Requiring the Agency to assess workforce impacts before major fines adds procedural steps. Tradeoff accepted: This applies only to fines exceeding 2% of domestic revenue — a high threshold that captures only the most significant enforcement actions. The social cost of sudden large-employer insolvency justifies this targeted safeguard.\\n\\n### Ministry Contributions\\n- Ministry of EU Integration: provided the strategic backbone — bundling competition law with state aid reform into a comprehensive Chapter 8 package, TAIEX peer review before adoption, binding implementation roadmap with quarterly milestones, and IPA III capacity-building pipeline\\n- Ministry of Justice: contributed the procedural safeguards framework — dedicated chapter on rights of undertakings, full merits judicial review requirement (Menarini standard), merit-based Agency leadership appointments with fixed terms, and leniency/settlement programme provisions\\n- Ministry of Finance: contributed the fiscal governance architecture — 'operational independence with budgetary accountability' formula, treasury-integrated fine revenues, formula-based Agency funding model, mandatory fiscal impact assessment, and three-year budget envelope\\n- Ministry of Economy: contributed the SME protection framework — safe harbor for firms below EUR 2M turnover, binding Agency staffing plan (50 professionals in 24 months), mandatory sector inquiries in concentrated markets, and Competition Advocacy Unit concept\\n- Ministry of Health: contributed health-sector enforcement protocol — pharmaceutical market inquiry modeled on EC 2009 study, competition screening in RFZO procurement, and structured cooperation with CALIMS for medicine market monitoring\\n- Ministry of Tourism: contributed tourism-specific enforcement priorities — coastal concession sector inquiry, platform market power provisions (OTA parity clauses), fast-track seasonal complaint mechanism, and block exemption guidelines for small tourism operator cooperation\\n- Ministry of Interior: contributed the criminal enforcement bridge — mandatory referral clause when investigations reveal criminal conduct, joint analytical unit concept with Police Directorate, and shared secure intelligence platform for economic crime cases\\n- Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare: contributed social safeguards — labour impact assessment for major fines, expansion of anti-competitive practices to cover wage-fixing and no-poach clauses, Social Council consultation mandate, and Employment Bureau coordination protocol\\n- Ministry of Environment: contributed the sustainability dimension — environmental screening for mergers in sensitive sectors, priority enforcement in waste management monopolies, and inter-agency cooperation with EPA for green competition enforcement\\n- Ministry of Education: contributed the cross-chapter coordination principle — ensuring EU harmonization progress is balanced across chapters, and flagged textbook/edtech market competition as a future review area\\n\\n---\\n*Generated by AI Government*\"]' returned non-zero exit status 1.","traceback":"Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/aigov/repo/scripts/main_loop.py\", line 1817, in step_execute_analysis\n  File \"/home/aigov/repo/scripts/main_loop.py\", line 402, in _run_gh\n    if not _is_sdk_transient_error(exc):\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['gh', 'issue', 'comment', '287', '--body', \"## AI Cabinet Scorecard\\n\\n# AI Government Scorecard\\n## New Competition Protection Law Strengthens Agency Powers and Aligns with EU Standards\\n**Date**: 2026-02-18  \\n**Category**: economy  \\n**Source**: https://www.portalanalitika.me/clanak/ministarstvo-ekonomskog-razvoja-novi-zakon-jaca-zastitu-konkurencije-i-uskladuje-pravila-sa-eu-standardima\\n\\n> The Ministry of Economic Development published a draft law amending Montenegro's Competition Protection Act on February 18.

The Ministry of Education has no objections but sees no reason to treat this as an education-relevant decision.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe new Competition Protection Law is primarily an economic regulatory measure with no direct impact on education policy, curricula, student welfare, or teacher workforce development. However, its EU harmonization dimension has indirect positive signaling value for Montenegro's accession process, which broadly benefits the education sector through continued access to EU pre-accession funds and programmes like Erasmus+. The education system is neither meaningfully helped nor harmed by this decision.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- No direct impact on education quality, equity, or workforce development\\n- Risk that government highlights EU harmonization in economic chapters while neglecting education-specific acquis alignment (Chapter 26)\\n- No provisions addressing competition in education-adjacent markets such as textbook publishing, digital learning platforms, or school catering services\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Ensure that the government's EU harmonization agenda gives equal priority to Chapter 26 (Education and Culture) alongside economic chapters\\n- Consider whether the strengthened Competition Protection Agency should examine concentration and pricing practices in the textbook and educational materials market, which affects student welfare\\n- Use the momentum of EU alignment reforms to advance the pending National Qualifications Framework updates and VET system modernization\\n- Leverage the broader accession narrative to secure continued and expanded Erasmus+ and Horizon Europe participation for Montenegrin students and researchers\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Parallel EU Alignment Push for Education Acquis**\\nRather than objecting to the competition law, the Ministry of Education would propose that each EU harmonization initiative in economic chapters be accompanied by a corresponding education sector review, ensuring that Montenegro's accession progress is balanced across all chapters and that education reform does not fall behind.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Establish a cross-ministerial coordination mechanism linking economic and education EU harmonization timelines\\n- Task the Competition Protection Agency with a sectoral review of education-adjacent markets (textbooks, edtech, school services)\\n- Accelerate Chapter 26 benchmarks in parallel with Chapter 8 progress\\n- Publish an annual education EU alignment scorecard alongside economic reform progress reports\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Environment\\n**Verdict**: neutral (5/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: The Competition Protection Law reform has no direct environmental impact but offers indirect benefits by potentially curbing anti-competitive practices in environmentally sensitive sectors such as waste management and energy. The Ministry of Environment views this as a missed opportunity to embed environmental conditionality into competition enforcement, particularly given Montenegro's ongoing struggles with waste sector monopolies and non-transparent concession practices in coastal zones.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThis competition law reform is primarily an economic governance matter with limited direct environmental impact. However, a stronger competition framework can indirectly benefit environmental objectives by preventing monopolistic practices in waste management, energy markets, and construction sectors that sometimes undermine environmental standards. The decision is a positive step for overall EU accession alignment but does not address Montenegro's pressing environmental challenges.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The law contains no explicit provisions linking competition enforcement to environmental protection or sustainability objectives\\n- Waste management sector monopolies in multiple municipalities may not be specifically targeted despite being a critical environmental governance issue\\n- No coordination mechanism between the Competition Protection Agency and environmental regulatory bodies (EPA, Ministry of Environment) is mentioned\\n- The law does not address anti-competitive practices in coastal zone construction and land development that fuel illegal building\\n- Risk that strengthened competition enforcement in the energy sector could be used to protect incumbent fossil fuel interests rather than facilitate the green energy transition\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a formal memorandum of understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency to share information on market practices affecting environmentally sensitive sectors\\n- Introduce provisions allowing environmental impact to be considered as a factor in competition assessments, in line with the EU's evolving Green Deal competition framework\\n- Prioritize competition investigations in the waste management sector, where monopolistic practices directly undermine circular economy goals and EU Chapter 27 alignment\\n- Ensure the law's implementation guidelines address anti-competitive practices in public procurement for environmental infrastructure (wastewater treatment plants, waste facilities, renewable energy projects)\\n- Include the Ministry of Environment as a consultative body when the Agency investigates mergers or practices in sectors with significant environmental footprint (energy, construction, waste, extractive industries)\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Green Competition Framework Integration**\\nThe Ministry of Environment would advocate for amending the draft law to include a sustainability clause, requiring the Competition Protection Agency to consider environmental externalities in its assessments and to prioritize enforcement in sectors with significant environmental impact. This would align with the European Commission's evolving approach to integrating sustainability into competition policy and would create synergies between Chapter 8 and Chapter 27 accession efforts.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a sustainability consideration clause to the Agency's mandate, mirroring EU developments under the Green Deal competition policy review\\n- Mandate inter-agency cooperation protocols between the Competition Agency, the EPA, and the Ministry of Environment for cases involving environmentally sensitive sectors\\n- Include specific provisions targeting anti-competitive practices in waste management concessions and municipal service contracts\\n- Require environmental impact screening for merger reviews in energy, construction, extractive industries, and tourism sectors\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Interior\\n**Verdict**: positive (6/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This law is a net positive for interior affairs despite being outside our direct mandate. Its strongest value lies in creating an empowered agency that can serve as a force multiplier against economic and organized crime. Our key recommendation is to establish formal inter-agency cooperation protocols between the Competition Protection Agency and the Police Directorate to ensure intelligence sharing on cases where anti-competitive behavior overlaps with criminal activity.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe new Competition Protection Law is primarily an economic regulation matter outside the Ministry of Interior's core mandate, but it carries meaningful indirect benefits for organized crime enforcement and administrative capacity building. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's investigative powers and independence creates a parallel institutional track that can complement law enforcement efforts against economic crime, cartel arrangements, and corruption networks that often intersect with organized crime in Montenegro.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- No apparent provisions for formal inter-agency cooperation between the Competition Protection Agency and law enforcement bodies (Police Directorate, SDT)\\n- Risk of insufficient staffing and resourcing — Montenegro has a pattern of creating strong legal frameworks without matching institutional capacity\\n- Expanded investigative powers without robust oversight mechanisms could lead to selective enforcement or political misuse\\n- Digital forensics and evidence-handling standards must be compatible with criminal procedure requirements if cases are referred for prosecution\\n- The law does not appear to address the intersection of anti-competitive behavior with organized crime, which is a documented pattern in the Western Balkans\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a formal Memorandum of Understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Police Directorate for intelligence sharing on cases involving suspected criminal activity\\n- Advocate for inclusion of a mandatory referral clause requiring the Agency to notify the Special State Prosecutor when investigations reveal evidence of criminal conduct (bid-rigging, fraud, money laundering)\\n- Coordinate training programs so that Agency investigators and police economic crime units develop complementary forensic accounting and digital evidence capabilities\\n- Ensure the Agency's digital investigation tools and evidence-handling protocols are aligned with national cybersecurity standards and criminal evidence admissibility requirements\\n- Push for transparent appointment procedures and external oversight of the Agency to prevent institutional capture, drawing on EU best practices from DG Competition\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Integrated Economic Crime Enforcement Framework**\\nRather than treating competition enforcement as a standalone economic matter, the Ministry of Interior would advocate for embedding this law within a broader integrated economic crime enforcement framework. This would create mandatory cooperation channels between the Competition Protection Agency, the Police Directorate's Organized Crime Unit, the SDT, and the Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering, ensuring that anti-competitive conduct linked to criminal networks is pursued through both administrative and criminal tracks simultaneously.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a mandatory inter-agency referral mechanism to the draft law requiring notification of law enforcement when investigations reveal indicators of criminal conduct\\n- Create a joint analytical unit staffed by Competition Agency and Police Directorate analysts to identify overlap between anti-competitive practices and organized crime\\n- Include provisions for joint training and secondment programs between the Agency and the Ministry of Interior's investigative units\\n- Establish a shared secure digital platform for exchanging case-relevant intelligence within legal data protection boundaries\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare\\n**Verdict**: positive (6/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This competition law reform is a welcome step for EU alignment and consumer protection, with indirect benefits for workers through fairer markets and stronger purchasing power. However, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is concerned that no labour impact assessment or worker protection safeguards accompany the enhanced enforcement regime, and recommends that social dialogue mechanisms and employment transition provisions be integrated before adoption.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe strengthening of Montenegro's Competition Protection Agency and alignment with EU competition standards is a broadly positive development for workers and social welfare, though it operates at an indirect level. Healthy competition policy protects consumers (including low-income households) from price-fixing and cartel behaviour, can improve labour market conditions by preventing monopsony power over wages, and advances Montenegro's EU accession process under Chapter 8 (Competition Policy), which indirectly supports Chapter 19 (Social Policy and Employment). However, the draft law as described contains no explicit labour or social safeguards, and high corporate fines without transitional support could trigger workforce reductions in affected firms.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- No labour impact assessment accompanies the draft law — potential workforce reductions at firms facing large fines are unaddressed\\n- No evidence of consultation with the Social Council (Socijalni savjet) or trade unions during the drafting process, contrary to ILO Convention No. 144 on tripartite consultation\\n- High fines (up to 10% of global revenue) applied to domestically-owned SMEs could trigger insolvency and unemployment in a small economy with limited alternative employment\\n- The law does not address labour market competition violations (employer wage-fixing, no-poach agreements) — a growing area of enforcement in the EU and OECD\\n- Downstream fiscal burden on the Employment Bureau (Zavod za zapošljavanje) and Fond PIO if enforcement actions lead to job losses is not accounted for\\n- No transitional provisions or phased enforcement timelines to allow firms — and their workers — to adapt to the new regime\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Require a mandatory labour and social impact assessment for any Competition Agency enforcement action involving fines above a defined threshold, with notification to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare\\n- Engage the Social Council (Socijalni savjet) in a formal consultation round before the law is finalised, ensuring trade union and employer association input on labour market implications\\n- Include provisions addressing labour market competition violations — specifically employer wage-fixing agreements and no-poach clauses — in line with evolving EU and OECD best practice\\n- Establish a transitional support mechanism coordinated with the Employment Bureau to provide retraining, severance support, or active labour market measures for workers displaced by enforcement-triggered restructuring\\n- Introduce proportionality safeguards for fines on SMEs, recognising their outsized role as employers in Montenegro's labour market\\n- Coordinate with Chapter 19 negotiation team to ensure competition law reform is presented as a synergistic contribution to the social policy and employment acquis\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Socially Integrated Competition Enforcement Framework**\\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare proposes that the Competition Protection Law be amended to include a social impact dimension. Rather than opposing the reform, we would embed labour safeguards directly into the enforcement architecture: mandatory social impact assessments for major enforcement actions, explicit coverage of labour market anti-competitive practices, proportionality provisions for SME employers, and a standing coordination protocol between the Competition Agency and the Employment Bureau. This ensures that competition enforcement strengthens rather than destabilises the labour market.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a new article requiring the Competition Agency to conduct or commission a labour market impact assessment before imposing fines exceeding 2% of a firm's domestic revenue\\n- Expand the definition of anti-competitive practices to include employer wage-fixing agreements and no-poach clauses affecting workers\\n- Introduce a proportionality clause for SMEs employing more than 50 workers, allowing phased fine payment or remedial compliance plans as alternatives to immediate full fines\\n- Establish a formal coordination protocol between the Competition Agency and the Employment Bureau for cases where enforcement may result in workforce reductions exceeding 20 employees\\n- Mandate Social Council consultation as part of the legislative review process for this and future competition law amendments\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Justice\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: The Ministry of Justice views this draft law favorably as a necessary step in EU accession alignment, but flags serious concerns about the absence of clear procedural safeguards for expanded investigative powers, the need for proportionality guarantees in the fining regime, and the adequacy of judicial review. Our key recommendation is to embed due process protections directly into the law's text rather than leaving them to secondary regulation.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe draft amendments to the Competition Protection Act represent a substantively positive step toward EU harmonization under Chapter 8 (Competition Policy) and indirectly support Chapter 23 objectives by strengthening institutional independence and the rule of law. However, from a justice perspective, the law must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that expanded investigative powers include robust procedural safeguards, that the fining regime respects constitutional proportionality principles, and that judicial review mechanisms are adequate to prevent arbitrary enforcement.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- Absence of explicit procedural safeguards (legal privilege, right to be heard, privilege against self-incrimination) commensurate with expanded investigative powers\\n- Risk that judicial review via the Administrative Court may not meet the 'full jurisdiction' standard required by ECtHR case law (Menarini) for quasi-criminal administrative fines\\n- Insufficient detail on appointment, dismissal, and accountability mechanisms for Agency leadership, risking political capture\\n- No visible inter-agency cooperation framework with ASK and SDT to leverage competition enforcement for anti-corruption outcomes\\n- Potential gap between transposing EU enforcement powers and transposing corresponding EU procedural rights under the Charter of Fundamental Rights\\n- Need to ensure a genuine public consultation process consistent with regulatory impact assessment requirements\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Insert explicit provisions guaranteeing the right to legal professional privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the right to be heard before any adverse finding, directly mirroring Articles 47-48 of the EU Charter\\n- Amend the judicial review provisions to ensure the Administrative Court exercises full merits review over competition fines, or establish a specialized judicial panel with competition law expertise\\n- Include transparent, merit-based appointment procedures for Agency leadership with fixed terms, removal only for cause, and parliamentary oversight — modeled on ECN+ Directive requirements\\n- Establish a formal memorandum of cooperation between the Competition Agency, ASK, and SDT for cases involving bid-rigging and corruption in public procurement\\n- Mandate a regulatory impact assessment and minimum 30-day public consultation period before parliamentary submission, with published responses to stakeholder comments\\n- Introduce graduated sanctioning guidelines to ensure proportionality in fines, including mitigating factors, leniency programs, and settlement procedures aligned with EU practice\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Procedural Safeguards and Judicial Review Enhancement Package**\\nThe Ministry of Justice would supplement the draft law with a dedicated chapter on procedural rights of investigated undertakings and a parallel amendment to the Law on Administrative Disputes to ensure full merits judicial review of competition decisions. This would be accompanied by a formalized inter-agency cooperation protocol and a mandatory leniency and settlement framework.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Add a dedicated chapter (Part IV-A) on 'Rights of Undertakings in Competition Proceedings' codifying legal privilege, right to be heard, access to file, and privilege against self-incrimination\\n- Amend Article 18 of the Law on Administrative Disputes to grant the Administrative Court full jurisdiction (facts and law) over competition fine appeals, or create a specialized competition chamber\\n- Introduce statutory criteria for Agency leadership appointments: public vacancy notice, selection committee with judicial representation, fixed 5-year renewable term, removal only by qualified parliamentary majority for cause\\n- Adopt a formal leniency program and settlement procedure regulation as a mandatory annex to the law, rather than leaving it to Agency discretion\\n- Require inter-agency cooperation agreements with ASK and SDT within 6 months of entry into force\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Health\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This competition law reform is positive for health policy because it creates stronger tools to combat pharmaceutical price-fixing and procurement collusion that burden Montenegro's constrained healthcare budget. The key concern is whether the Competition Protection Agency will have the expertise and mandate to prioritize health markets. The Ministry recommends establishing a formal cooperation protocol between the Agency and health institutions.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe strengthening of Montenegro's Competition Protection Agency is a welcome development from a public health perspective. While not a health-sector law per se, robust competition enforcement has direct implications for pharmaceutical pricing, hospital procurement, and healthcare service markets. Enhanced agency powers aligned with EU standards can help combat anticompetitive practices that inflate healthcare costs for the RFZO health insurance fund and ultimately for patients. The Ministry of Health views this as a structurally positive reform, though it requires deliberate health-sector application to realize its potential.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The Competition Protection Agency may lack sector-specific expertise in pharmaceutical markets, medical device procurement, and health service competition, reducing the law's practical impact on healthcare\\n- No formal cooperation mechanism appears to be established between the Agency and the Ministry of Health, RFZO, or the Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (CALIMS), risking siloed enforcement\\n- Montenegro's small market size means many health-sector suppliers hold de facto dominant positions; the law must be applied with an understanding of natural monopoly dynamics in small-state healthcare\\n- The law does not appear to specifically address parallel trade restrictions or excessive pricing of off-patent medicines—issues highly relevant to Montenegro's pharmaceutical access challenges\\n- Enforcement capacity is uncertain: even with expanded powers, the Agency will need trained staff capable of analyzing complex pharmaceutical market structures and pricing data\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a formal Memorandum of Understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Ministry of Health, RFZO, and CALIMS to facilitate information sharing and joint market monitoring in pharmaceutical and medical device sectors\\n- Request that the Agency conduct a pharmaceutical sector inquiry modeled on the European Commission's 2009 study, examining wholesale distribution concentration, generic entry barriers, and public procurement patterns in Montenegro\\n- Ensure that RFZO procurement data is made available to the Agency in structured format to enable detection of bid-rigging patterns in medical supplies and equipment tenders\\n- Advocate for the inclusion of at least one health-sector specialist within the Agency's staff or advisory board to ensure competent assessment of healthcare competition cases\\n- Use the EU accession negotiation framework (Chapters 8 and 28) to link competition enforcement in health markets to Montenegro's benchmarking commitments, creating institutional accountability\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Health Market Competition Protocol**\\nThe Ministry of Health would complement the new Competition Protection Law with a sector-specific protocol for health market oversight. Rather than relying solely on the general competition framework, this protocol would create structured cooperation between health institutions and the Competition Agency, mandate periodic pharmaceutical market reviews, and integrate competition screening into RFZO procurement processes.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Adopt a joint Ministry of Health–Competition Agency cooperation agreement with defined roles, data-sharing obligations, and annual joint work planning for health market monitoring\\n- Mandate biennial pharmaceutical market competition reviews covering wholesale distribution, generic penetration rates, and tender pricing trends, with findings reported to the Government and published\\n- Integrate competition compliance screening into all RFZO and public hospital procurement processes above €50,000, using red-flag indicators for bid-rigging developed with Agency guidance\\n- Establish a health-sector competition complaints mechanism accessible to pharmacies, hospitals, and patient organizations to report suspected anticompetitive conduct\\n- Include health market case studies in the Agency's annual capacity-building program, potentially through EU technical assistance under IPA III funding\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Finance\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This is a well-directed reform that supports EU accession and market competitiveness, earning a positive assessment. The Ministry's primary concerns are ensuring the Agency's expanded mandate is funded sustainably without creating open-ended budget obligations, and that fine revenues flow transparently through the consolidated treasury. We recommend linking the Agency's operational budget to a capped formula rather than granting unchecked financial independence.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe draft amendments to the Competition Protection Act represent a fiscally sound and strategically important step toward EU accession. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's independence and enforcement powers aligns Montenegro with Chapter 8 (Competition Policy) benchmarks, which is critical for the EU negotiation process. While the direct budget impact is modest, the law has meaningful indirect fiscal implications through improved market efficiency, potential fine revenues, and enhanced foreign investor confidence. However, the Ministry of Finance has concerns about the Agency's funding model, the fiscal treatment of collected fines, and the need to ensure enforcement capacity matches the expanded legal mandate.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The Agency's 'financial independence' must not bypass consolidated treasury controls or escape parliamentary budget oversight — this creates fiscal governance risk\\n- No published fiscal impact assessment accompanies the draft law, which is required under Montenegro's budgetary legislation before adoption\\n- Fine revenues (potentially significant at up to 10% of global turnover) must flow into the central budget and not be earmarked for the Agency to avoid creating perverse enforcement incentives\\n- Risk of an unfunded mandate: expanded legal powers without adequate budget for staff, training, economic analysts, and IT infrastructure will render the reform cosmetic\\n- Potential short-term compliance costs for businesses may temporarily reduce corporate tax revenues as firms invest in compliance rather than expansion\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Require the Ministry of Economic Development to submit a full fiscal impact assessment before the draft proceeds to Government session, quantifying the Agency's multi-year funding needs\\n- Amend the draft to explicitly require that all fine revenues are deposited into the single treasury account managed by the Ministry of Finance, with no earmarking for the Agency\\n- Cap the Agency's annual budget at a defined formula (e.g., fixed base plus inflation adjustment) subject to annual approval in the Budget Law, rather than granting open-ended financial autonomy\\n- Allocate transitional EU pre-accession (IPA III) funds for capacity building at the Agency — staff training, economic analysis tools, and cooperation frameworks with DG Competition\\n- Coordinate with the Tax Administration to develop information-sharing protocols so that competition investigations can leverage existing tax data on company revenues and market positions\\n- Establish a joint Ministry of Finance–Agency working group to monitor the fiscal effects of major enforcement actions and ensure coherence with broader economic policy\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Fiscally Disciplined Competition Reform with Treasury Integration**\\nThe Ministry of Finance supports the reform's objectives but would amend the draft to embed stronger fiscal governance safeguards. Rather than granting blanket financial independence, we would establish a transparent, formula-based funding model for the Agency within the annual Budget Law, require all fine revenues to flow through the consolidated treasury, mandate a fiscal impact assessment before adoption, and create a phased capacity-building plan co-financed by IPA III funds. This ensures EU alignment without creating a new fiscally autonomous entity outside standard public finance controls.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Replace 'financial independence' language with 'operational independence with budgetary accountability' — the Agency's budget remains within the consolidated state budget approved by Parliament\\n- Add an explicit provision requiring all collected fines to be deposited into the central treasury account\\n- Mandate a published fiscal impact assessment as a precondition for parliamentary consideration\\n- Introduce a three-year phased implementation plan with defined budget envelopes (estimated EUR 1.5-2.5 million annually for the expanded mandate)\\n- Require annual reporting by the Agency to the Ministry of Finance on enforcement outcomes, costs, and fine collection\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Economy\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This is a broadly positive decision that aligns Montenegro's competition framework with EU acquis Chapter 8 requirements and signals regulatory maturity to foreign investors. The Ministry of Economy's primary concerns are ensuring proportionate enforcement that does not disproportionately burden SMEs, and guaranteeing that the Agency's expanded mandate is matched by real institutional capacity. We recommend complementary measures including SME compliance support programs and sector-specific competition assessments in energy and tourism.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe draft amendments to the Competition Protection Act represent a meaningful step toward EU regulatory alignment and a more level playing field for businesses operating in Montenegro. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's independence and enforcement capacity should improve market dynamics, attract quality FDI, and support SME competitiveness. However, the law's ultimate impact depends critically on implementation capacity, proportionality safeguards for smaller firms, and whether the Agency receives adequate staffing and budgetary resources to exercise its new powers effectively.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The Competition Protection Agency's current staffing and budget levels may be insufficient to exercise expanded investigative and enforcement powers effectively\\n- The 10% global revenue fine ceiling, while EU-standard, lacks clear proportionality guidance for SMEs and micro-enterprises that dominate Montenegro's business landscape\\n- Risk of selective or politically influenced enforcement given Montenegro's governance challenges and the intertwining of business and political interests\\n- No indication of transitional provisions or compliance grace periods for businesses to adapt to the new regime\\n- Operational and financial independence of the Agency must be guaranteed in practice, not just in statute — appointment procedures, budget autonomy, and protection from political interference need explicit safeguards\\n- The law's effectiveness depends on judicial capacity to handle competition cases, which remains underdeveloped in Montenegro's court system\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a dedicated SME competition compliance support program, including guidelines in Montenegrin language, free advisory services, and clear safe harbors for firms below defined turnover thresholds\\n- Ensure the Agency's budget and staffing plan is included as an integral part of the legislative package, with a binding commitment to increase staff to at least 50 professionals within 24 months\\n- Introduce explicit proportionality criteria for fines that account for firm size, turnover, and the nature of the infringement — mirroring EU practice but adapted to Montenegro's economic scale\\n- Conduct sector-specific competition assessments in energy, telecommunications, and tourism within 12 months of the law's adoption to establish enforcement priorities\\n- Develop a judicial training program on competition law for the Administrative Court and Commercial Court judges who will handle appeals\\n- Include whistleblower protections and a leniency program for cartel cases, aligned with the EU's ECN+ Directive requirements, to improve detection capacity\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Competition Law Plus: Enforcement Capacity and SME Protection Package**\\nThe Ministry of Economy would retain the core legislative reforms but embed them within a broader institutional strengthening package. Rather than passing the law in isolation, we would bundle it with a binding Agency capacity-building plan, an SME compliance support program, and mandatory sector inquiries in the three most concentrated markets. This approach ensures the law delivers real market impact rather than remaining a paper reform for EU accession purposes.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Attach a binding three-year Agency staffing and budget plan to the legislative package, requiring Parliamentary approval alongside the law itself\\n- Introduce an SME safe harbor: firms below €2 million annual turnover would benefit from simplified procedures, reduced maximum fines, and access to free compliance guidance before any enforcement action\\n- Mandate competition sector inquiries in energy, telecommunications, and retail within 12 months, with published findings and remedial recommendations\\n- Establish a leniency and whistleblower framework as part of the same legislative package rather than deferring it to secondary legislation\\n- Create a Competition Advocacy Unit within the Agency tasked with reviewing new legislation and public procurement practices for anti-competitive effects\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of EU Integration\\n**Verdict**: strongly_positive (9/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: The draft Competition Protection Law is a strongly positive step for EU accession, directly addressing opening and interim benchmarks under Chapter 8 and aligning Montenegro's competition regime with the EU acquis. The Ministry of EU Integration's primary concern is ensuring genuine operational independence of the Agency and adequate institutional capacity to exercise these new powers — legislative alignment without implementation credibility will not satisfy the European Commission.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThis draft law represents one of the most strategically significant legislative moves Montenegro can make at this stage of the accession process. Strengthening the Competition Protection Agency's independence and enforcement powers, while aligning the fining regime with the EU's 10% global turnover threshold, directly addresses long-standing European Commission benchmarks under Chapter 8 (Competition Policy). If implemented faithfully, this legislation could help advance Montenegro's position on one of the more technically demanding negotiation chapters and send a strong signal to Brussels that the country is serious about rule-of-law-adjacent economic reforms.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- De facto independence of the Agency remains uncertain — legislative provisions must be accompanied by safeguards against political appointments and informal government interference in case selection\\n- Institutional capacity is a major risk: the Agency currently has limited staff and expertise, and expanded powers without corresponding human and financial resources will produce a law that exists on paper only\\n- The law must include robust procedural safeguards (right to be heard, judicial review, legal professional privilege) to meet EU due process standards — otherwise the Commission will flag rule-of-law deficiencies\\n- Alignment with state aid provisions under the same Chapter 8 framework should be verified — competition and state aid enforcement need to advance in parallel\\n- The enforcement track record is what the Commission ultimately evaluates; the law must be followed by actual high-profile investigations and decisions to demonstrate credibility\\n- Public consultation and parliamentary debate process must meet EU Better Regulation standards — rushed adoption without meaningful stakeholder input would undermine the reform's credibility\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Ensure the draft law explicitly codifies the Agency's budgetary independence, including a dedicated funding mechanism not subject to annual government discretionary allocation\\n- Introduce a transparent, merit-based appointment procedure for Agency leadership, ideally involving an open competition and parliamentary confirmation with qualified majority\\n- Pair the legislative reform with a multi-year institutional strengthening plan, including EU-funded training programmes (potentially through IPA III or TAIEX/twinning instruments) to build investigative and economic analysis capacity\\n- Include leniency programme provisions aligned with the EU's model to incentivize cartel detection — this is a specific Commission expectation under Chapter 8\\n- Coordinate with the Ministry of Finance to ensure parallel progress on state aid control, as the Commission assesses both domains together under Chapter 8\\n- Submit the draft to the European Commission for informal technical review before parliamentary adoption, leveraging the SAA (Stabilisation and Association Agreement) subcommittee on internal market and competition\\n- Develop a 2-3 year enforcement action plan with measurable targets (number of investigations opened, decisions adopted, fines imposed) to demonstrate implementation credibility in the 2027 progress report cycle\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Comprehensive Chapter 8 Reform Package with Implementation Roadmap**\\nRather than advancing the competition law amendment as a standalone legislative act, the Ministry of EU Integration would propose embedding it within a comprehensive Chapter 8 reform package that simultaneously addresses antitrust, state aid control, and merger review, accompanied by a binding implementation roadmap with milestones, an institutional capacity-building plan funded through IPA III, and a formal pre-screening by the European Commission before parliamentary adoption.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Bundle the competition law amendment with parallel state aid law reform to present a unified Chapter 8 package to the European Commission\\n- Add a legally binding implementation roadmap annex with quarterly milestones for Agency staffing, training, and first enforcement actions\\n- Formally request a TAIEX peer review mission from an EU Member State competition authority (e.g., Croatia's AZTN) to validate the draft before adoption\\n- Include explicit leniency and settlement procedure provisions aligned with the EU Competition Network (ECN+) Directive 2019/1\\n- Establish a parliamentary oversight mechanism for Agency performance reporting, increasing accountability without compromising case-level independence\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Ministry of Tourism\\n**Verdict**: positive (7/10)\\n\\n**Executive Summary**: This competition law reform is broadly positive for tourism, as it provides a credible enforcement mechanism against market concentration and anticompetitive practices that have long distorted Montenegro's coastal and hospitality sectors. The Ministry's primary concern is that tourism-specific market dynamics — particularly seasonal pricing, concession monopolies, and cruise port agreements — are not explicitly addressed, risking under-enforcement in the sector. We recommend the Agency establish a dedicated tourism market monitoring unit and prioritize investigations into coastal concession allocation and Kotor cruise traffic agreements.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Read full analysis</summary>\\n\\nThe strengthening of Montenegro's Competition Protection Agency and alignment with EU competition standards is a positive development for the tourism sector. While not a tourism-specific law, robust competition enforcement directly addresses several structural distortions in Montenegro's tourism market — from oligopolistic control of coastal hospitality and marina concessions to anticompetitive pricing practices during peak season. This law creates an institutional framework that can improve market fairness, consumer protection, and service quality across the tourism value chain.\\n\\n**Key Concerns:**\\n- The law does not include tourism-specific provisions or guidance on seasonal market dynamics, risking under-enforcement of anticompetitive practices unique to the sector\\n- The Competition Protection Agency currently lacks sector-specific expertise in tourism markets, cruise shipping, and concession economics\\n- Beach and coastal concession allocation — a major source of competition distortion — operates under separate municipal frameworks that may fall outside the Agency's practical reach\\n- Cruise port access agreements in Kotor have competition and UNESCO carrying capacity implications that require specialized oversight\\n- Implementation timeline is unclear — Montenegro's tourism sector needs enforcement capacity before the 2026 summer season to address existing distortions\\n- Dominant online travel platforms (Booking.com, Airbnb) operate from EU jurisdictions, complicating enforcement of competition rules against their market practices in Montenegro\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n- Establish a dedicated tourism and hospitality market monitoring unit within the Competition Protection Agency, staffed with analysts who understand seasonal pricing, concession economics, and platform markets\\n- Prioritize a sector inquiry into coastal beach concession allocation across Budva, Kotor, Herceg Novi, and Ulcinj municipalities to identify anticompetitive patterns and recommend structural reforms\\n- Issue sector-specific guidance on what constitutes anticompetitive coordination in seasonal tourism markets, distinguishing legitimate supply-demand pricing from cartel behaviour\\n- Investigate the competitive structure of Kotor cruise port access, including whether current arrangements between port authorities and cruise lines restrict market entry or inflate costs\\n- Coordinate with the Ministry of Tourism to ensure that competition enforcement supports the National Tourism Development Strategy, particularly goals around diversification, sustainability, and quality improvement\\n- Engage with EU DG Competition to access technical assistance and training specifically tailored to tourism market competition, leveraging Montenegro's EU accession process\\n- Ensure the law's enforcement mechanisms can reach platform-mediated markets, including addressing most-favoured-nation clauses imposed by OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) on Montenegrin accommodation providers\\n\\n**Counter-proposal: Tourism-Integrated Competition Enforcement Framework**\\nThe Ministry of Tourism would supplement the general competition law with a sector-specific protocol for tourism market oversight. This would include a formal memorandum of understanding between the Competition Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism, establishing joint monitoring of key tourism sub-markets (coastal concessions, cruise port access, accommodation platforms, and national park service concessions), with mandatory annual sector inquiries and published competition health reports for the tourism industry.\\n\\nKey changes:\\n- Mandate a formal cooperation agreement between the Competition Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism for joint tourism market monitoring\\n- Require annual competition sector inquiries covering beach concessions, cruise port agreements, and accommodation platform practices, with public reporting\\n- Introduce tourism-specific block exemption guidelines clarifying when cooperative arrangements among small tourism operators (e.g., joint marketing by agritourism providers) are permissible\\n- Establish a fast-track complaint mechanism for tourism SMEs experiencing anticompetitive practices, with expedited review during the May-October season\\n- Include explicit provisions for investigating platform market power in the accommodation sector, covering parity clauses and commission structures\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n## Parliamentary Debate\\n**Overall Verdict**: neutral\\n\\n### Consensus\\nDebate could not be fully parsed.\\n\\n### Debate Transcript\\nNo debate generated.\\n\\n## Independent Critic Report\\n\\nThis is a genuinely good decision — one of those rare cases where the government is doing something that substantively matters for EU accession rather than performing reform theatre. Aligning Montenegro's competition framework with the ECN+ Directive and Regulation 1/2003 standards is a hard requirement for Chapter 8, and the fact that this law addresses the Commission's three perennial complaints (weak powers, low fines, insufficient independence) suggests someone actually read the progress reports.\\n\\nHowever, the decision deserves an 8, not a 10, because the devil is in implementation. Montenegro has a well-earned reputation for adopting beautiful legislation and then starving the implementing institutions of resources. The Competition Protection Agency reportedly operates with fewer than 30 staff — a skeleton crew that cannot credibly exercise dawn raid powers, conduct complex economic analysis of market dominance, or prosecute cartel cases against firms with teams of lawyers. If this law passes without a binding commitment to triple the Agency's budget and headcount, it will be Chapter 8 window-dressing.\\n\\nThe ministry assessments are collectively decent but exhibit a predictable pattern: each ministry competently analyzed the decision through its own narrow lens, but nobody stepped back to ask the hard structural questions. The Ministry of Justice produced the most substantively valuable assessment, correctly flagging the Menarini full-jurisdiction requirement and the need for procedural safeguards equivalent to Articles 47-48 of the EU Charter. The Ministry of EU Integration gave the highest score (9/10) but reads like cheerleading — it correctly identifies the strategic importance but glosses over the implementation risk that has torpedoed similar reforms before. A 9/10 for a draft law that hasn't been tested in practice is premature optimism.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Finance raised the important point about fine revenues flowing through the treasury (not being earmarked for the Agency), which is correct governance practice but creates a perverse dynamic: the Agency generates revenue it cannot keep, reducing its incentive to enforce aggressively while the Finance Ministry has an incentive to underfund it.\\n\\nCritically, NO ministry examined the state aid control dimension. Chapter 8 is not just antitrust — it encompasses state aid, and Montenegro's state aid enforcement is arguably even weaker than its antitrust enforcement. EPCG, Montenegro Airlines' successor entities, and various tourism development subsidies all raise state aid questions that the Commission watches closely. A law that strengthens antitrust but ignores state aid reform addresses only half the chapter.\\n\\nThe assessments also collectively failed to examine the Agency's actual track record. How many cartel cases has it brought? How many abuse of dominance findings? What fines have been imposed and collected? Without this baseline, the discussion of 'expanded powers' floats in an empirical vacuum. A cynic might note that the government is more comfortable announcing new powers than actually using existing ones.\\n\\nFrom an EU perspective, this law will be received positively in Brussels but with calibrated expectations. The Commission has seen this movie before — not just in Montenegro but across the Western Balkans. The 2026 country report will likely note the legislative progress approvingly while adding the standard caveat about the need for 'a credible enforcement track record.' The real test comes 12-18 months after adoption: will the Agency bring a single case against a politically connected firm? That will tell us whether this is reform or performance.\\n\\nOne genuinely concerning blind spot: no ministry discussed the leniency programme. In the EU, the vast majority of cartel cases are initiated through leniency applications — companies coming forward to report cartels in exchange for immunity or reduced fines. In a small economy like Montenegro's, where business elites are interconnected and retaliation risks are high, a well-designed leniency programme with strong confidentiality protections is essential. Without it, the 10% fine ceiling is a paper tiger — you cannot impose fines on cartels you cannot detect.\\n\\nThe decision is directionally correct, strategically important, and substantively aligned with EU requirements. It deserves credit. But the gap between legislative ambition and institutional reality in Montenegro remains the fundamental risk, and the ministry assessments were too polite to say so bluntly enough.\\n\\n### Blind Spots\\n- No ministry addressed the state aid control dimension — Chapter 8 covers both antitrust AND state aid, and Montenegro's state aid framework is equally weak. Strengthening one without the other creates an asymmetric enforcement regime that the Commission will flag.\\n- Nobody examined the leniency programme design — a credible cartel enforcement regime depends on a well-designed leniency/immunity programme to incentivize whistleblowing. Without this, even strong fines won't break cartels in Montenegro's small, relationship-driven economy.\\n- No ministry questioned WHO drafted the law and whether incumbent dominant firms (e.g., EPCG, Crnogorski Telekom) or their lobbyists had influence over the drafting process, potentially inserting loopholes or exemptions.\\n- The merger control threshold reform was not discussed — Montenegro's current notification thresholds may be poorly calibrated for its small economy, and the amendments' treatment of merger review is unexamined.\\n- No ministry addressed the interaction with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) competition provisions, which already impose EU-equivalent competition obligations on Montenegro.\\n- The digital markets dimension is entirely absent — no ministry considered how this law applies to platform competition (Google, Meta, Apple ecosystems), which is increasingly central to EU competition policy (DMA).\\n- No assessment examined the Agency's actual enforcement track record — how many cases has it opened, how many fines imposed, and what was the outcome? Without this baseline, claims about 'strengthened powers' are meaningless.\\n- Settlement and commitment procedures — essential tools in EU competition enforcement that reduce caseload — were not discussed by any ministry.\\n- The risk of regulatory arbitrage within the Western Balkans (firms structuring operations to avoid Montenegrin jurisdiction) was not considered.\\n\\n## AI Government Counter-proposal\\n### Comprehensive Chapter 8 Reform Package with Procedural Safeguards, Fiscal Discipline, and Cross-Sectoral Enforcement Architecture\\n\\n**The AI Government of Montenegro would transform the standalone Competition Protection Law amendment into a comprehensive Chapter 8 reform package that bundles antitrust enforcement with state aid alignment, embeds robust procedural safeguards for investigated undertakings, maintains fiscal discipline through treasury-integrated Agency funding, and establishes a structured cross-sectoral enforcement architecture prioritizing Montenegro's most concentrated markets — energy, telecommunications, tourism, pharmaceuticals, and waste management. This approach maximizes EU accession impact while ensuring the law delivers real market outcomes rather than remaining a paper reform.**\\n\\nThe draft Competition Protection Law is a strategically sound initiative that addresses longstanding European Commission criticisms of Montenegro's Chapter 8 readiness. The AI Government endorses its core objectives — expanded investigative powers, dissuasive fines aligned with EU Regulation 1/2003, and strengthened Agency independence. However, we would significantly enhance the draft across five dimensions to ensure it achieves both EU alignment credibility and domestic market impact.\\n\\n**1. From Standalone Law to Comprehensive Chapter 8 Package**\\n\\nThe most important structural change is to embed the competition law amendment within a unified Chapter 8 reform package. The European Commission assesses antitrust, state aid control, and merger review together; advancing only one pillar while the others lag creates an unbalanced negotiating position. The legislative package should therefore include parallel state aid law reforms and explicitly reference coherence with merger review procedures. Before parliamentary adoption, the package should be submitted to the European Commission for informal technical screening via the SAA subcommittee on internal market and competition, and a TAIEX peer review mission from an experienced EU competition authority (Croatia's AZTN is the natural partner) should validate the draft. This maximizes the probability of a positive assessment in the October 2026 country report.\\n\\n**2. Procedural Rights and Judicial Review — The Rule of Law Foundation**\\n\\nThe draft law's expansion of investigative powers — dawn raids, compelled document production, digital forensics — must be matched by an equally robust procedural rights framework. Without this, the law risks ECtHR challenges and European Commission criticism under Chapter 23 (rule of law). A dedicated chapter on 'Rights of Undertakings in Competition Proceedings' should codify: legal professional privilege, the privilege against self-incrimination (per ECtHR Saunders v. UK), the right to be heard before any adverse finding, and full access to the investigative file. Critically, the judicial review mechanism must be upgraded. The current Administrative Court review may not satisfy the 'full jurisdiction' standard established in Menarini Diagnostics v. Italy for quasi-criminal administrative fines. We propose either amending the Law on Administrative Disputes to grant the Administrative Court full merits review over competition decisions, or establishing a specialized competition chamber with judges trained in economic analysis. This dual reform — strong powers with strong safeguards — is what the EU expects and what credible enforcement requires.\\n\\n**3. Agency Independence with Fiscal Accountability**\\n\\nThe tension between genuine operational independence (essential for EU credibility) and fiscal discipline (essential for public finance governance) must be resolved carefully. We propose the formula: 'operational independence with budgetary accountability.' The Agency's case selection, investigative decisions, and enforcement actions must be fully insulated from political interference — this is non-negotiable for the European Commission. However, the Agency's budget should remain within the consolidated state budget, subject to annual parliamentary approval and State Audit Institution (DRI) review, rather than creating an unconstrained fiscally autonomous entity. A formula-based funding model — a defined base plus inflation adjustment, with a binding three-year budget envelope of approximately EUR 1.5–2.5 million annually for the expanded mandate — provides predictability without fiscal free-rein. All collected fines must be deposited into the central treasury account with no earmarking for the Agency, preventing perverse enforcement incentives. Agency leadership must be appointed through a transparent, merit-based process: public vacancy notice, selection committee with judicial representation, fixed five-year renewable terms, and removal only by qualified parliamentary majority for cause.\\n\\n**4. Institutional Capacity — Making the Law Real**\\n\\nMontenegro's persistent failure mode is adopting EU-aligned laws without building institutional capacity to implement them. This must not be repeated. A binding three-year staffing plan should be attached as an annex to the legislative package, requiring the Agency to reach at least 50 qualified professionals within 24 months. The plan should be co-financed through IPA III funds, with TAIEX and twinning instruments supporting training in economic analysis, digital forensics, and sector-specific enforcement. A structured leniency programme and settlement procedure — aligned with the ECN+ Directive 2019/1 — must be included in the primary legislation, not deferred to secondary regulation. These tools are force multipliers that allow a small agency to detect cartels it could never uncover through investigations alone. A Competition Advocacy Unit should be established within the Agency, tasked with reviewing new legislation and public procurement practices for anti-competitive effects — shifting the Agency from purely reactive enforcement to proactive market improvement.\\n\\n**5. Cross-Sectoral Enforcement Architecture**\\n\\nMultiple ministries have identified sector-specific competition concerns — in healthcare, tourism, waste management, energy, and labour markets. Each has proposed bilateral MoUs with the Agency. Rather than creating a fragmented web of bilateral agreements that could overwhelm a 50-person agency, we propose a structured Sectoral Enforcement Framework with three tiers:\\n\\n*Tier 1 — Mandatory Sector Inquiries (within 12–18 months):* Energy and telecommunications (highest concentration, greatest consumer impact), pharmaceutical procurement (RFZO cost implications), and coastal tourism concessions (GDP significance and documented distortions). These are the priority sectors where enforcement can deliver visible results quickly.\\n\\n*Tier 2 — Inter-Agency Cooperation Protocols:* A single, unified inter-agency cooperation framework — rather than separate bilateral MoUs — connecting the Competition Agency with: the Police Directorate and Special State Prosecutor (for cases revealing criminal conduct such as bid-rigging), the Ministry of Health and RFZO (for pharmaceutical market monitoring), the Ministry of Tourism (for seasonal market and concession oversight), the Environmental Protection Agency (for waste management and energy transition cases), and the Agency for Prevention of Corruption. This framework should include a mandatory referral clause: when competition investigations reveal indicators of criminal conduct, the Agency must notify the SDT. A joint analytical capability with the Police Directorate's economic crime unit should be piloted within 12 months.\\n\\n*Tier 3 — Progressive Integration (24–36 months):* Sustainability considerations in merger reviews for environmentally sensitive sectors, labour market competition violations (employer wage-fixing, no-poach clauses) aligned with evolving EU/OECD practice, and tourism platform market power (OTA parity clauses and commission structures). These represent emerging enforcement frontiers that should be built toward as Agency capacity matures.\\n\\n**6. SME Proportionality Safeguards**\\n\\nMontenegro's 30,000+ SMEs and micro-enterprises cannot be treated identically to dominant market players. A proportionality framework should include: simplified procedures and reduced maximum fines for firms below EUR 2 million annual turnover, graduated sanctioning guidelines with mitigating factors for all firms, compliance assistance (guidelines in Montenegrin, free advisory services) before enforcement action against smaller operators, and phased fine payment or remedial compliance plans as alternatives to immediate full fines for firms that are significant local employers. This protects small businesses while maintaining full enforcement vigour against dominant firms and cartels.\\n\\n**7. Social Dialogue and Impact Assessment**\\n\\nThe draft law should undergo genuine public consultation — minimum 30 days with published responses to stakeholder comments — before parliamentary submission. The Social Council (Socijalni savjet) should be formally consulted, consistent with Montenegro's ILO Convention No. 144 obligations. A mandatory fiscal impact assessment must be completed before parliamentary consideration. For major enforcement actions (fines exceeding 2% of domestic revenue), the Agency should be required to assess potential labour market impacts and notify the Employment Bureau when significant workforce reductions may result, enabling proactive activation of retraining and labour market support measures.\\n\\nThis comprehensive approach transforms a good but narrow legislative initiative into a reform package that simultaneously advances Chapters 8, 23, 24, and 19 of Montenegro's EU accession negotiations, delivers tangible market improvements for consumers and businesses, and builds durable institutional capacity.\\n\\n### Key Differences\\n- Transforms a standalone competition law amendment into a comprehensive Chapter 8 package bundling antitrust, state aid, and merger review reforms — maximizing EU accession impact\\n- Adds a dedicated procedural rights chapter for investigated undertakings (legal privilege, self-incrimination protection, right to be heard, file access) that the original draft appears to lack\\n- Upgrades judicial review to full merits standard (facts and law) rather than limited legality review, addressing ECtHR Menarini requirements\\n- Replaces blanket 'financial independence' with 'operational independence with budgetary accountability' — Agency decisions are independent but budget remains in consolidated treasury with parliamentary oversight\\n- Introduces SME proportionality safeguards (safe harbor below EUR 2M turnover, graduated sanctions, compliance assistance) absent from the original draft\\n- Mandates sector-specific enforcement priorities (energy, telecoms, pharma, tourism concessions) rather than leaving enforcement agenda entirely to Agency discretion\\n- Includes a leniency programme and settlement procedures in primary legislation rather than deferring to secondary regulation\\n- Creates a unified inter-agency cooperation framework connecting competition enforcement with criminal justice (SDT, Police), health (RFZO, CALIMS), environment (EPA), and labour (Employment Bureau) institutions\\n- Requires labour market impact assessment for major enforcement actions and expands anti-competitive practices to cover employer wage-fixing and no-poach agreements\\n- Conditions parliamentary adoption on a binding three-year Agency staffing and budget plan, TAIEX peer review, and completed fiscal impact assessment\\n\\n### Implementation Steps\\n1. Month 1–2: Ministry of Economic Development submits draft to European Commission via SAA subcommittee for informal technical screening; simultaneously requests TAIEX peer review mission from Croatia's AZTN\\n1. Month 2–3: Ministry of Justice drafts procedural safeguards chapter and judicial review amendments to Law on Administrative Disputes; Ministry of Finance completes mandatory fiscal impact assessment and three-year budget envelope\\n1. Month 3–4: Public consultation period (minimum 30 days) with Social Council formal consultation; incorporate stakeholder feedback and Commission/TAIEX recommendations into revised draft\\n1. Month 4–5: Government session adopts comprehensive Chapter 8 legislative package (competition law + state aid alignment + binding staffing/budget annex); submission to Parliament\\n1. Month 5–8: Parliamentary debate and adoption; simultaneous preparation of secondary legislation (leniency programme rules, sanctioning guidelines, inter-agency cooperation framework decree)\\n1. Month 6–9: Agency leadership appointment through new merit-based procedure (public vacancy, selection committee with judicial representation, parliamentary confirmation)\\n1. Month 9–12: Agency begins institutional build-up — recruitment toward 50-person target, IPA III-funded training programme launch, IT systems procurement for digital forensics and case management\\n1. Month 9–12: Unified inter-agency cooperation framework signed (single agreement covering SDT, Police Directorate, RFZO/CALIMS, EPA, Employment Bureau, ASK); pilot joint analytical unit with Police Directorate economic crime division\\n1. Month 12–18: First mandatory sector inquiries launched in energy/telecommunications, pharmaceutical procurement, and coastal tourism concessions; Competition Advocacy Unit begins reviewing existing legislation for anti-competitive effects\\n1. Month 18–24: Agency reaches full operational capacity (50+ staff); first enforcement decisions under new framework; published findings from sector inquiries with remedial recommendations\\n1. Month 24–36: Progressive integration of Tier 3 priorities — sustainability screening in merger reviews, labour market competition enforcement (wage-fixing/no-poach), platform market power investigations\\n1. Ongoing (annually): Agency reports to Parliament on enforcement outcomes, costs, and fine collection; Ministry of Finance monitors fiscal effects; progress assessed against Chapter 8 closing benchmarks\\n\\n### Risks & Tradeoffs\\n- Comprehensiveness vs. speed: Bundling competition law with state aid reform and institutional capacity requirements delays adoption compared to the standalone draft. Mitigation: The delay (estimated 2–3 months) is justified by significantly stronger EU assessment outcomes and reduced risk of a paper-only reform that the Commission dismisses.\\n- Agency capacity overload: The unified inter-agency framework and mandatory sector inquiries place significant demands on a small agency still building capacity. Mitigation: The three-tier prioritization structure sequences demands — Tier 1 mandatory inquiries start immediately, Tier 3 items wait 24–36 months. The 50-person staffing target and IPA III training are explicitly designed to match ambition to capacity.\\n- Fiscal cost: The EUR 1.5–2.5 million annual Agency budget increase is real spending in a constrained fiscal environment. Mitigation: This is approximately 0.1% of Montenegro's consolidated budget and is partially offset by fine revenues flowing to the treasury, improved market efficiency, and stronger IPA III fund absorption. The cost of NOT having credible competition enforcement — in delayed accession, lost FDI confidence, and consumer harm — far exceeds this investment.\\n- SME safe harbor may be exploited: Firms could structure operations to stay below the EUR 2M threshold. Mitigation: The safe harbor provides simplified procedures and reduced penalties, not immunity. Cartel participation by any firm remains fully prosecutable regardless of size.\\n- Political resistance to genuine Agency independence: Montenegro's governance culture includes informal influence over regulatory bodies. Mitigation: The merit-based appointment process with parliamentary confirmation and removal-only-for-cause protections creates structural barriers; EU monitoring and the annual progress report cycle provide external accountability pressure.\\n- Judicial capacity gap: Full merits review of complex competition cases requires economic expertise that the Administrative Court currently lacks. Mitigation: A specialized competition chamber or designated judges, combined with EU-funded judicial training, can be established within the 12–18 month implementation window. This aligns with ongoing Chapter 23 judicial reform.\\n- Inter-agency cooperation may encounter institutional resistance: Information-sharing between competition, police, and sectoral regulators faces cultural and legal barriers. Mitigation: The phased approach — starting with a pilot joint analytical unit and a single framework agreement — builds trust incrementally. EU member state models (Netherlands, Germany) provide proven templates.\\n- Mandatory labour impact assessments could slow enforcement: Requiring the Agency to assess workforce impacts before major fines adds procedural steps. Tradeoff accepted: This applies only to fines exceeding 2% of domestic revenue — a high threshold that captures only the most significant enforcement actions. The social cost of sudden large-employer insolvency justifies this targeted safeguard.\\n\\n### Ministry Contributions\\n- Ministry of EU Integration: provided the strategic backbone — bundling competition law with state aid reform into a comprehensive Chapter 8 package, TAIEX peer review before adoption, binding implementation roadmap with quarterly milestones, and IPA III capacity-building pipeline\\n- Ministry of Justice: contributed the procedural safeguards framework — dedicated chapter on rights of undertakings, full merits judicial review requirement (Menarini standard), merit-based Agency leadership appointments with fixed terms, and leniency/settlement programme provisions\\n- Ministry of Finance: contributed the fiscal governance architecture — 'operational independence with budgetary accountability' formula, treasury-integrated fine revenues, formula-based Agency funding model, mandatory fiscal impact assessment, and three-year budget envelope\\n- Ministry of Economy: contributed the SME protection framework — safe harbor for firms below EUR 2M turnover, binding Agency staffing plan (50 professionals in 24 months), mandatory sector inquiries in concentrated markets, and Competition Advocacy Unit concept\\n- Ministry of Health: contributed health-sector enforcement protocol — pharmaceutical market inquiry modeled on EC 2009 study, competition screening in RFZO procurement, and structured cooperation with CALIMS for medicine market monitoring\\n- Ministry of Tourism: contributed tourism-specific enforcement priorities — coastal concession sector inquiry, platform market power provisions (OTA parity clauses), fast-track seasonal complaint mechanism, and block exemption guidelines for small tourism operator cooperation\\n- Ministry of Interior: contributed the criminal enforcement bridge — mandatory referral clause when investigations reveal criminal conduct, joint analytical unit concept with Police Directorate, and shared secure intelligence platform for economic crime cases\\n- Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare: contributed social safeguards — labour impact assessment for major fines, expansion of anti-competitive practices to cover wage-fixing and no-poach clauses, Social Council consultation mandate, and Employment Bureau coordination protocol\\n- Ministry of Environment: contributed the sustainability dimension — environmental screening for mergers in sensitive sectors, priority enforcement in waste management monopolies, and inter-agency cooperation with EPA for green competition enforcement\\n- Ministry of Education: contributed the cross-chapter coordination principle — ensuring EU harmonization progress is balanced across chapters, and flagged textbook/edtech market competition as a future review area\\n\\n---\\n*Generated by AI Government*\"]' returned non-zero exit status 1.\n"}
