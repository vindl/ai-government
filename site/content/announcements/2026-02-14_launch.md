# AI Government of Montenegro — Project Launch

AI Government of Montenegro is an independent project that uses artificial intelligence to analyze government decisions in the public interest.

The system simulates a cabinet composed of AI agents representing key ministries — finance, justice, European integration, health, internal affairs, education, economy, tourism, and environment. Each decision undergoes independent analysis, parliamentary debate, and critical review.

The goal is not to replace democratic institutions, but to strengthen transparency: making power legible, surfacing what officials would rather hide, and providing citizens with the analysis they need to hold their government accountable.

All source code, methodology, and prompts are publicly available. The project does not accept funding or direction from any political party or government body.
