# Challenges of Governance in Montenegro

*This page documents the structural challenges, inefficiencies, and systemic problems in Montenegrin governance that this project monitors. All claims are sourced from international bodies (EU, GRECO, IMF, OECD, Transparency International, Freedom House, RSF, MONEYVAL, WHO, OECD PISA) and the project's own multi-ministry analyses.*

## 1. The Implementation Gap

Montenegro adopts EU-aligned legislation at pace — 13 of 33 accession chapters closed as of January 2026 — but implementation chronically lags behind adoption.

- In February 2026, Parliament passed 25 EU-related laws in a single session without plenary debate. This project's Justice agent scored it **4/10** — the only negative verdict across all analyses — because fast-track adoption bypasses the scrutiny that makes laws functional.
- GRECO found that of **22 anti-corruption recommendations, only 3 were fully implemented** (2024). Eight were untouched.
- The OECD SIGMA 2024 report found that public administration reforms "have not yet materialized."

This is what Article 11 of the project's Constitution targets: *"measure the gap between rhetoric and action."*

## 2. Judicial Capture and the Rule of Law

The judiciary is the weakest link in Montenegro's governance, and the one that matters most for EU accession (Chapters 23 and 24).

- A former president of the Supreme Court was sentenced to 10 years in prison (January 2026) for protecting a criminal network and exerting unlawful influence over the judiciary.
- In December 2024, Parliament unilaterally retired a Constitutional Court judge, bypassing constitutional procedure. The **Venice Commission confirmed this was unconstitutional**.
- Roughly **a quarter of judicial and prosecutorial positions remain vacant**.
- Freedom House classifies Montenegro as a **"Transitional or Hybrid Regime"** (46/100).

## 3. Public Administration Bloat and Patronage

- Approximately **86,000 workers (~30% of the labor force)** are in the public sector — roughly one in every five citizens.
- Public sector salaries have **surpassed private sector salaries**, draining talent from private enterprise.
- The OECD SIGMA report found that employment growth is driven "in large part due to political patronage."
- In July 2025, the cabinet was expanded to **32 members** to secure a parliamentary majority.

Article 12 of the project's Constitution: *"Government should cost less, not more."*

## 4. Organized Crime in State Institutions

Criminal networks have penetrated judicial and security institutions.

- The Global Organized Crime Index gives Montenegro a criminality score of **5.90** (second highest in the Western Balkans) and a resilience score of only **4.75** (second lowest in the region).
- A long-running clan war originating from Kotor Bay has claimed over **80 lives since 2015**. Europol estimates the groups involved control at least 30% of the cocaine trade from Latin America to Europe.
- Top judicial and security officials have been arrested for ties to organized crime.
- MONEYVAL found that money laundering investigations and convictions are **"low and inconsistent"** with the country's risk profile.

## 5. Education System in Crisis

Nearly half of Montenegro's 15-year-olds lack basic competencies.

- **PISA 2022** — Math: 406, Reading: 405, Science: 403. All well below OECD averages (472, 476, 485) and all **declined from 2018**.
- **42–48% of students** did not meet minimum proficiency in any domain.
- Montenegro has **no data** on how many students studying abroad will return.
- ~50% of young people report thinking about leaving the country.

---

## 6. Brain Drain and Demographic Decline

- Population: **623,633** (2023 census). Projected to **shrink by 15%**.
- The northern region lost **20,000 inhabitants** in 10 years.
- Youth unemployment: **~26%**, despite labor shortages in tourism.
- Only **31 medical graduates per year**.
- Montenegro has the **lowest proportion of pharmacists per capita in Europe** (17 per 100,000).

---

## 7. Healthcare Under Strain

- Out-of-pocket payments account for **38% of health spending** (EU average: ~15–20%).
- **9% of households** experience catastrophic health spending.
- Severe shortages of pharmacists, midwives, nurses, and specialists.
- Quality varies dramatically between urban and rural areas.

---

## 8. Fiscal Sustainability

Montenegro uses the euro without eurozone membership, limiting monetary policy tools.

- Public debt: projected **~61% of GDP by 2026**, rising to ~65% by 2030.
- Fiscal deficit widening: 2.9% (2024) → 3.6% (2025), projected to exceed 4% by 2030.
- Current account deficit: **~18% of GDP**.
- Shadow economy: **~30% of GDP**.
- Cost-benefit analysis is systematically absent from government decisions.

---

## 9. Media Freedom

- RSF Press Freedom rank: **37th/180** (2025) — improved, but structural problems persist.
- The public broadcaster RTCG was reclassified as **"State Controlled"** after government interventions.
- In March 2025, **101 civil society organizations** protested amendments that would give political figures direct control over RTCG.

---

## 10. Political Instability

- Three decades of single-party dominance ended in 2020, but legacy patronage networks remain embedded in institutions.
- The President and Prime Minister, originally allies, split in early 2025.
- The ruling coalition spans ideologically incompatible factions.
- Laws are pushed through expedited procedures with minimal public debate.

---

## How These Problems Connect

These are not separate failures. They form a reinforcing cycle:

**Political instability** → patronage hiring → **public admin bloat** → fiscal strain → **underfunded institutions** → weak enforcement → **organized crime penetration** → judicial capture → **rule of law deficit** → EU accession delays → **brain drain** → demographic decline → fast-track legislation → **implementation gap** → no real reform → political instability.

This project's multi-ministry analysis structure is designed to catch the cross-cutting failures that siloed government misses.
