      "score": 5,
      "summary": "The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments represent a well-intentioned public safety initiative, but the Ministry of Finance identifies several fiscal concerns. The decision lacks a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, fails to specify budget allocation for approximately 100 digital radars and enforcement infrastructure, and provides no revenue projection from fines. While increased fines (€300-600 for young drivers, €150-400 for parents) may generate revenue, the decision omits implementation costs, maintenance expenses, and potential impact on consumer spending by young adults. The measure requires fiscal clarification before full endorsement.",
      "reasoning": "From a fiscal policy perspective, this decision presents both revenue opportunities and unquantified expenditure obligations that require careful scrutiny.\n\n**Budget Impact Concerns:** The most significant fiscal gap is the absence of cost estimates for deploying approximately 100 stationary digital radars. Modern speed enforcement systems cost €15,000-50,000 per unit (depending on technology), suggesting a capital expenditure of €1.5-5 million. The decision provides no indication whether this will be funded through the 2026 budget, require supplementary appropriations, or be financed through public-private partnerships. Additionally, ongoing maintenance, data processing infrastructure, and personnel training represent recurring costs that are not addressed.\n\n**Revenue Projections Missing:** While the amendments introduce substantial fines (€300-600 for young driver violations, €150-400 for parental liability), the decision lacks revenue projections. Without baseline data on expected violations or enforcement rates, the Ministry of Finance cannot assess whether fine revenue will offset implementation costs. Historical enforcement data from the Ministry of Interior should inform these projections, but such analysis is absent from the decision.\n\n**EU Alignment and Road Safety Investment:** From an EU accession perspective, road safety improvements align with Chapter 14 (Transport Policy) requirements. Montenegro's traffic fatality rate (approximately 7-8 per 100,000 inhabitants) exceeds the EU average (~4.5), making investments in safety infrastructure justifiable. However, EU best practices require impact assessments that quantify costs, benefits, and behavioral change assumptions—elements missing from this decision.\n\n**Economic Impact on Youth Demographics:** The midnight-to-5am driving ban and vehicle power restrictions for 18-21 year-olds may have secondary economic effects. Young adults represent a significant portion of night-shift workers in tourism and hospitality sectors (approximately 15-20% of Montenegro's GDP). Restricting their mobility could create labor market frictions, potentially requiring employers to adjust shifts or provide transportation, with unknown fiscal implications for employment tax revenue. This macroeconomic linkage warrants analysis.\n\n**Municipal Police Expansion and Fiscal Decentralization:** Granting municipal police expanded authority for parking and stopping violations shifts enforcement responsibilities and potentially revenue streams to local governments. Without clarity on revenue-sharing arrangements between central and municipal budgets, this could create fiscal tensions or reduce central government fine revenue. The decision should specify whether municipalities retain collected fines (as occurs in some EU jurisdictions) or remit them to the central treasury.\n\n**Opportunity Cost and Prioritization:** With Montenegro's 2026 budget approximately €2 billion and public debt around 60-65% of GDP, every capital expenditure must be prioritized. While road safety is important, the decision does not demonstrate how digital radar deployment compares to competing priorities such as healthcare infrastructure, education technology, or climate resilience investments required under EU Green Agenda commitments.\n\n**Positive Fiscal Elements:** The decision does show fiscal responsibility in establishing deterrent-level fines and creating parental liability mechanisms, which may reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with traffic accidents. If properly enforced, these measures could decrease emergency medical expenditures and disability payments—though again, no quantification is provided.",

This counter-proposal requires minimal legislative changes—only addition of fiscal reporting requirements and fund creation clauses to the existing amendments. The Ministry of Interior already possesses accident location data to identify pilot sites. International development partners (EU, EBRD) have demonstrated willingness to co-finance road safety programs, potentially reducing net budget impact further. Phased implementation is standard practice in EU member states (e.g., Slovenia's gradual speed camera deployment 2015-2020). The main implementation challenge is inter-ministerial coordination (Interior, Economic Development, Finance), which can be addressed through existing Government Coordination Body mechanisms.

      "score": 7,
      "summary": "The Ministry of Education views these road safety amendments positively as they directly protect our student population, particularly secondary school and university students aged 16-21 who represent a vulnerable demographic in traffic incidents. The midnight-to-5am driving ban for young drivers and electric scooter age restrictions align with our duty of care for student welfare. However, the decision lacks integration with educational institutions for awareness campaigns, driver education curriculum improvements, and coordination with schools to maximize preventive impact beyond enforcement.",
      "reasoning": "From the Education Ministry's perspective, this decision addresses a critical student safety concern. Montenegro's young population, especially upper secondary and university students, faces disproportionate traffic accident risks. RTCG and police statistics consistently show 18-24 year-olds overrepresented in serious accidents, often involving nighttime driving and excessive speed. The midnight curfew directly protects students returning from evening study sessions, part-time work, or social activities—a demographic we monitor closely.\n\nThe 80 kW engine power limit is evidence-based and protective. University of Montenegro students, particularly those from rural areas who commute to Podgorica, often drive older, powerful vehicles beyond their experience level. This restriction, while potentially unpopular, reduces catastrophic accident risk during the critical early driving years when our students are simultaneously managing academic pressures.\n\nElectric scooter regulation fills a dangerous gap. In Podgorica, Bar, and Budva, we've observed students as young as 12-13 using scooters for school commutes without helmets or traffic knowledge. The age 16 minimum with parental liability creates accountability and aligns with our existing framework where parents are responsible for student welfare until legal adulthood.\n\nHowever, the decision is purely enforcement-focused and misses educational opportunities. Traffic safety education in Montenegrin schools remains inconsistent—some gymnasia include it in civic education, while others do not. The Vocational Education and Training (VET) centers preparing auto mechanics and transport technicians lack standardized road safety modules. The government could have mandated traffic safety integration into the curriculum, particularly in final years of secondary education (age 17-18) when students approach driving age.\n\nAdditionally, there's no provision for school-police coordination. Our institutions could host awareness sessions, distribute materials, or integrate these new rules into existing school safety protocols. The University of Montenegro's Faculty of Mechanical Engineering could partner on road safety research, providing evidence for future policy iterations—a missed opportunity for applied research and student engagement.\n\nThe brain drain angle is subtle but present: traffic fatalities among educated youth represent irreversible human capital loss. Every young person killed or seriously injured in a preventable accident is a potential graduate, researcher, or skilled worker lost. In a country of 620,000 where we struggle to retain talent, protecting our student population's physical safety is economic policy.\n\nFinally, the financing mechanism is unclear. Will fine revenues fund road safety education programs? Infrastructure improvements near schools? Without earmarking, we risk these becoming general budget revenues rather than reinvestment in prevention.",
      "key_concerns": [
        "No integration of traffic safety education into mandatory school curriculum despite clear policy need",

Rural pilot requires modest funding (€50,000-80,000 annually for 3 municipalities) and coordination with local governments, which already cooperate on student transport subsidies. Digital platform development by university students is low-cost (€15,000-25,000) and aligns with existing IT curriculum practicum requirements. Greatest challenge is inter-ministerial coordination with Interior and Finance, but traffic safety is politically popular and consensus-building should succeed.

      "score": 5,
      "summary": "The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments represent a public safety measure with limited direct economic impact. While improved road safety could marginally reduce accident-related economic costs and enhance Montenegro's image for tourism, the decision introduces minor negative effects on youth employment mobility and the emerging micro-mobility sector. The €300-600 fines and midnight driving ban may constrain young workers in hospitality and tourism (sectors with late-night shifts), while electric scooter regulations could slow micro-mobility business development without clear infrastructure investment. Overall economic impact is negligible compared to core economic policy priorities.",
      "reasoning": "From the Ministry of Economy's perspective, this decision addresses road safety—a legitimate public policy goal—but falls outside our primary mandate areas. The economic analysis reveals modest indirect effects:\n\n**Tourism sector implications:** Montenegro's tourism industry (representing over 40% of GDP) relies heavily on seasonal young workers (18-21) who often work evening and night shifts in coastal hospitality businesses. The midnight-to-5am driving ban could reduce labor mobility for workers in Budva, Kotor, and other tourist centers where public transport is limited after midnight. This may increase employer costs (accommodation provision, transportation arrangements) or reduce youth employment in peak season roles. However, the magnitude is likely small—most seasonal workers are housed near workplaces.\n\n**Road safety and economic costs:** Traffic accidents impose economic costs through healthcare expenditure, lost productivity, and insurance claims. If these amendments reduce accident rates (unproven at this stage), there could be marginal fiscal savings. More importantly, Montenegro's reputation as a safe tourism destination matters for EU visitor confidence. High accident rates or unsafe road conditions can deter foreign tourists, particularly families and older travelers who represent higher per-capita spending.\n\n**Micro-mobility and entrepreneurship:** The electric scooter regulations (age 16+, parental fines) represent Montenegro's first formal regulation of this sector. This is positive from a legal clarity standpoint—investors in scooter-sharing businesses (e.g., Lime, Bolt, local startups) now have defined operating rules. However, the decision lacks any mention of infrastructure investment (dedicated lanes, parking zones) or business incentives. Without supportive infrastructure, Montenegro risks regulating a sector before enabling it to flourish. Regional competitors (Croatia, Albania) are investing in cycling and scooter infrastructure to attract younger, eco-conscious tourists.\n\n**Enforcement costs and SME impact:** The deployment of 100 digital radars and expanded municipal police authority will require budget allocation (likely €2-5 million for equipment and personnel). This represents a modest fiscal commitment with unclear ROI. For SMEs, particularly transport and logistics companies, stricter enforcement could increase operating costs if drivers accumulate fines. However, professional drivers should already comply with existing rules.\n\n**FDI and competitiveness:** No material impact. Foreign investors in manufacturing, energy, or real estate are not affected. The decision does not relate to EU single market alignment, state aid rules, or Energy Community obligations.\n\n**Youth employment and informal economy:** The midnight driving ban disproportionately affects young workers in the informal economy (estimated at 20-30% of Montenegro's labor force). Young people working informal night shifts—in cafes, bars, construction, or taxi services—may face reduced income opportunities. This could push more activity into illegality or reduce tax revenue from already-fragile formalization efforts.\n\n**Missing economic analysis:** The government provided no impact assessment on employment, tourism sector costs, or SME compliance burdens. No consultation with Hospitality Association, Chamber of Commerce, or tourism boards is mentioned. This suggests the decision was driven solely by Interior Ministry and police priorities, without economic ministry input.",

Political feasibility moderate—requires Prime Minister's Office to mandate economic impact assessments, which Interior Ministry may resist."

      "summary": "The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments represent a meaningful step toward reducing road fatalities through evidence-based restrictions on high-risk driver groups and modernized enforcement technology. The young driver restrictions align with EU best practices, while electric scooter regulation addresses a genuine regulatory gap. However, the decision raises significant concerns about police administrative capacity, digital infrastructure readiness, data protection compliance, and the lack of a comprehensive road safety strategy integrating prevention, education, and inter-agency coordination.",
      "reasoning": "From the Ministry of Interior's perspective, this decision addresses critical public safety gaps but reveals deeper structural challenges in Montenegro's approach to traffic enforcement and road safety.\n\n**Public Safety Impact — Strong Foundation**: The midnight-to-5am driving restriction for 18-21 year-olds is evidence-based. Young novice drivers are statistically over-represented in nighttime fatal crashes across Europe, and similar graduated licensing schemes in EU states (France, Austria, Slovenia) have demonstrated 15-30% reductions in young driver fatalities. The 80 kW engine power limit targets high-performance vehicles that exceed the skill level of novice drivers. These measures could meaningfully reduce Montenegro's road fatality rate, which remains among the highest in Europe (approximately 7-8 deaths per 100,000 population, compared to EU average of 4.2).\n\n**Electric Scooter Regulation — Overdue but Incomplete**: The introduction of age limits and parental liability for electric scooters addresses a genuine enforcement vacuum. Podgorica and coastal municipalities have seen proliferation of e-scooters with no regulatory framework, creating pedestrian safety hazards and legal ambiguity for police. However, the decision lacks critical details: helmet requirements, speed limits, dedicated lane usage rules, rental company obligations, and insurance requirements. Without these, enforcement will remain ad-hoc and inconsistent.\n\n**Law Enforcement Capacity — Critical Vulnerability**: The decision grants police expanded powers (temporary vehicle seizure, average speed enforcement) and promises deployment of approximately 100 digital radars, but provides no evidence of capacity analysis or implementation planning. Montenegro's Uprava policije faces chronic understaffing (approximately 3,500 officers for 620,000 population, below regional standards), aging infrastructure, and limited training in modern traffic enforcement technologies. Deploying 100 digital radars requires: procurement procedures (12-18 months under current Public Procurement Law), calibration and maintenance contracts, officer training in evidentiary standards, IT integration with centralized databases, and legal framework for automated penalty issuance. None of this is addressed.\n\n**Data Protection and Digital Infrastructure**: Average speed measurement systems and automated radar enforcement involve systematic processing of vehicle registration data and driver biometrics (facial recognition in some systems). Montenegro's Personal Data Protection Agency (AZLP) has repeatedly flagged Interior Ministry non-compliance with GDPR-equivalent standards. The decision contains no reference to data protection impact assessments, retention limits, or oversight mechanisms. This creates legal vulnerability and risks EU criticism during Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) negotiations.\n\n**Administrative Burden and Municipal Police**: Expanding municipal police authority for parking violations is sensible in principle (freeing state police for serious enforcement), but Montenegro's municipal police forces vary wildly in capacity. Podgorica has a semi-professional force; smaller municipalities have skeleton crews with minimal training. Without standardized training, equipment, and oversight protocols, this delegation will create enforcement gaps and corrupt opportunities (selective ticketing, informal settlements).\n\n**Missing Strategic Context**: The decision treats symptoms (young driver behavior, e-scooter chaos) without addressing root causes. Montenegro lacks: (1) a national road safety strategy integrating education, infrastructure (road design, signage), and enforcement; (2) coordination between Interior, Transport, Education, and Health ministries; (3) systematic crash data analysis (current reporting is fragmented between police, courts, and hospitals); (4) public awareness campaigns targeting cultural norms around speeding and drink-driving. EU member states achieving low fatality rates (Sweden, Netherlands) rely on Vision Zero frameworks combining all these elements. Montenegro's approach remains reactive and enforcement-centric.\n\n**Fiscal and Procurement Risks**: The decision implies significant capital expenditure (100 digital radars, IT systems, vehicle seizure facilities) with no budget allocation, procurement timeline, or cost-benefit analysis. Montenegro's public procurement track record in technology projects is poor (see: eZdravstvo delays, border management IT failures). Without transparent procurement and realistic implementation timelines, this risks becoming another unfunded mandate or corruption vulnerability.\n\n**Positive Elements**: Despite these concerns, the decision demonstrates political willingness to tackle road safety, adopts EU-aligned graduated licensing principles, and empowers police with modern tools. If implemented transparently with adequate capacity-building, it could catalyze broader road safety reform.",

      "summary": "The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments represent a positive step toward EU acquis alignment, particularly with Directive 2015/413 on cross-border enforcement and the broader EU road safety framework. The introduction of modern enforcement technologies (digital radars, average speed measurement) and age-based restrictions aligns with best practices in Member States. However, the decision lacks explicit reference to EU directives, misses opportunities for regional data-sharing cooperation, and does not mention IPA funding mechanisms that could support enforcement infrastructure. While technically sound, the reform would benefit from stronger institutional capacity-building and clearer alignment with Chapter 14 (Transport Policy) benchmarks.",
      "reasoning": "From an EU integration perspective, this decision demonstrates Montenegro's commitment to harmonizing its legal framework with European standards, though the alignment could be more explicit and comprehensive.\n\n**Acquis Alignment and Relevant Chapters:**\nThe amendments align with Chapter 14 (Transport Policy), which remains provisionally closed since 2018. The EU's road safety framework—particularly Directive 2015/413/EU on cross-border enforcement of road safety laws and the broader Vision Zero strategy—emphasizes graduated driver licensing, technology-based enforcement, and vulnerable road user protection. Montenegro's restrictions on young drivers (midnight-5am ban, power limitations) mirror systems in Austria, Germany, and France. The electric scooter regulation addresses a gap that many EU Member States only recently closed (e.g., France in 2019, Germany in 2019, Spain in 2021), showing Montenegro is keeping pace with emerging mobility challenges.\n\n**Missing EU Integration Opportunities:**\nThe decision text contains no reference to EU directives, European Commission recommendations, or the Road Safety Action Programme 2021-2030. This is a missed opportunity for demonstrating explicit acquis transposition. More critically, there is no mention of cross-border enforcement cooperation—Montenegro shares borders with four countries (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania, Croatia, with Croatia being an EU Member State). Directive 2015/413 requires exchange of vehicle registration data for cross-border offenses. The decision should have included provisions for interoperability with EU enforcement systems, particularly the EUCARIS (European Car and Driving License Information System) that Croatia uses.\n\n**Regional Cooperation and Benchmarks:**\nThe Western Balkans face similar road safety challenges—Serbia and North Macedonia have implemented comparable young driver restrictions. A coordinated regional approach, potentially under the Transport Community Treaty (which Montenegro ratified in 2017), would strengthen the reform's impact and demonstrate Montenegro's leadership in regional integration. The European Commission's 2025 Montenegro Progress Report (published October 2025) noted that road safety remains a concern, with fatality rates above the EU average. This reform addresses that criticism but would be stronger if framed as part of a multi-year road safety strategy with measurable targets aligned to EU benchmarks.\n\n**IPA Funding and Institutional Capacity:**\nThe decision mentions deploying \"approximately 100 stationary digital radars\" but does not specify funding sources. IPA III (2021-2027) includes substantial allocations for transport safety infrastructure. Montenegro should explicitly link this procurement to IPA funding, ensuring compliance with EU public procurement rules (Chapter 5) and leveraging technical assistance for installation, data management, and police training. The expanded police powers (vehicle seizure, municipal police authority) require institutional capacity-building—training programs co-financed through IPA would ensure officers understand proportionality, due process, and data protection standards (GDPR compliance is required under Chapter 23).\n\n**Positive Elements:**\nThe graduated licensing approach (restrictions for 18-21 age group) is evidence-based and reflects EU best practices. The parental liability mechanism for electric scooter violations is innovative and addresses a real enforcement gap. The average speed measurement technology is more effective than spot checks and is widely used in the Netherlands, UK, and Austria. These are substantive reforms, not cosmetic changes.\n\n**Concerns:**\nThe midnight-5am driving ban, while well-intentioned, may face implementation challenges in rural areas with limited public transport—this could disproportionately affect young people's access to employment and education, raising questions about proportionality under EU fundamental rights standards. The decision also lacks clarity on data protection safeguards for radar systems and vehicle registration databases, which must comply with GDPR and Law on Personal Data Protection (Montenegro's transposition of the GDPR). Finally, the absence of a public consultation reference is problematic—EU integration requires inclusive policymaking, and traffic safety affects all citizens.",

Public e-consultation infrastructure exists (e-uprava portal). The main challenge is inter-ministerial coordination, which can be addressed through a government decision establishing the EU Compatibility Committee with clear timelines (3-month implementation deadline). Police training via twinning is a proven mechanism—Slovenia has conducted similar projects in North Macedonia and Serbia. Total additional cost: approximately €50,000 for conference hosting and coordination staff time, offset by €2-4 million in IPA access.

      "summary": "The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments pursue legitimate public safety objectives but raise constitutional concerns regarding proportionality, age-based discrimination, and due process. While EU harmonization in road safety is positive, the legislation grants police excessive discretionary powers without adequate judicial oversight. The midnight driving ban for young adults (18-21) may violate constitutional equality principles, and vehicle seizure provisions lack clear procedural safeguards required by ECHR Article 1 Protocol 1 (property rights). Parental liability for children's scooter violations is legally sound. Overall, the law needs refinement to balance public safety with fundamental rights protections.",
      "reasoning": "From the Ministry of Justice perspective, this decision presents a mixed picture requiring careful constitutional and legal scrutiny.\n\n**Constitutional Compliance Concerns:**\nThe midnight-to-5am driving ban for citizens aged 18-21 raises serious equality concerns under Article 8 of the Montenegrin Constitution, which guarantees equal rights regardless of age. These individuals are legal adults with full constitutional rights, including freedom of movement (Article 39). While the state has legitimate interest in road safety, blanket time-based restrictions on adults—rather than evidence-based measures targeting specific risky behaviors—may fail the proportionality test established by the Constitutional Court. The Venice Commission has consistently emphasized that restrictions on fundamental rights must be necessary, proportionate, and based on objective evidence. The government has not presented statistical data demonstrating that time-of-day restrictions are more effective than alternative measures like enhanced training, graduated licensing systems used successfully in EU states, or stricter enforcement of existing DUI laws.\n\nThe 80 kW engine power restriction is more defensible as it addresses demonstrated risk factors for inexperienced drivers, though it would benefit from clearer graduated exceptions and alignment with EU best practices in graduated driver licensing.\n\n**Rule of Law and Due Process:**\nThe vehicle seizure provision is deeply problematic from a rule of law perspective. The text states police can seize vehicles from \"repeat serious traffic offenders\" but does not specify: (1) what constitutes a \"serious\" offense, (2) the precise procedural steps required before seizure, (3) how long vehicles may be held, (4) whether immediate judicial review is available, or (5) compensation mechanisms if seizure is later deemed unjustified. This grants police excessive discretionary power without judicial oversight, violating the principle that property deprivation (protected by ECHR Article 1 Protocol 1, which Montenegro must respect) requires clear legal basis and prompt judicial review. The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly ruled against Montenegro for inadequate procedural safeguards in property cases—this provision risks further ECHR violations and judgments against the state.\n\nMunicipality police expansion into traffic enforcement is administratively sensible but must be accompanied by clear competency delineation, training requirements, and accountability mechanisms to prevent jurisdictional conflicts and corruption opportunities. The law appears silent on these implementation details.\n\n**Human Rights Assessment:**\nParental liability for minors' electric scooter violations (€150-400) is legally sound and aligns with Montenegrin civil law principles of parental responsibility for minor children. However, the fines must be proportionate to avoid disproportionate burden on low-income families—€400 represents a significant penalty that could push vulnerable families into hardship. The law should include means-tested fine reductions or community service alternatives to ensure proportionality.\n\nThe electric scooter age restriction (16+) is reasonable and aligns with EU trends, though enforcement mechanisms are unclear—will police check IDs of every scooter rider? Practical enforceability concerns suggest this may become selectively enforced, risking arbitrary application.\n\n**EU Harmonization:**\nPositively, digital radar deployment and average speed measurement align with EU road safety directives and best practices. This technological modernization is overdue and will support evidence-based enforcement. However, Montenegro must ensure data protection compliance with GDPR-equivalent standards (EU Chapter 23 requirement) and transparent public procurement for radar systems to prevent corruption.\n\nThe law does not reference alignment with specific EU directives (e.g., Directive 2006/126/EC on driving licenses, Directive 2015/413 on cross-border enforcement). Explicit reference would strengthen legal certainty and EU accession credibility.\n\n**Anti-Corruption Risks:**\nExpanded police powers—especially discretionary vehicle seizure—create corruption opportunities unless accompanied by robust oversight. The law should mandate: (1) body cameras during traffic stops involving potential seizure, (2) immediate reporting to prosecutors, (3) public statistics on seizures by officer and location, and (4) penalties for abuse of authority. The Agency for Prevention of Corruption (ASK) should be tasked with monitoring implementation.\n\nRadar procurement (~100 units) represents significant public expenditure requiring transparent tender processes monitored by the State Audit Institution and Public Procurement Administration. The decision lacks mention of procurement safeguards.\n\n**Legislative Process Concerns:**\nThe summary does not indicate whether the bill underwent public consultation, impact assessment, or review by the Legal Committee of Parliament. EU Chapter 23 benchmarks require genuine stakeholder engagement and regulatory impact assessment for legislation affecting fundamental rights. The rushed timeline (approval on Feb 12, 2026) raises concerns about adequate deliberation.\n\n**Comparison with Regional Standards:**\nSerbia recently implemented graduated licensing without blanket time restrictions, focusing instead on BAC limits (zero tolerance for novice drivers) and mandatory advanced training. Croatia uses probationary periods with penalty point systems. These evidence-based approaches better balance safety and rights than Montenegro's blunt time ban.\n\n**Judicial Independence Implications:**\nThe lack of mandatory judicial review for vehicle seizures undermines judicial authority and violates separation of powers. Administrative acts depriving property must be subject to prompt judicial scrutiny—this is fundamental to rule of law and a non-negotiable EU requirement. The current text appears to allow police to act as judge and executioner.",

Judicial review infrastructure exists (Basic Courts handle administrative disputes). Main barriers are: (1) political resistance to removing populist 'tough on young drivers' messaging—requires public education on evidence-based effectiveness; (2) Police Directorate may resist judicial oversight and body cameras—needs Ministry of Interior leadership commitment; (3) drafting requires Constitutional Court informal pre-review (1-2 months) and genuine public consultation (not pro forma)—adds timeline but ensures constitutionality. Cost is comparable to original proposal (radar procurement dominates budget; body cameras ~€200k one-time, offset by corruption reduction). Croatia implemented similar graduated licensing in 2009-2011 during EU accession; Montenegro can adapt their legal framework. Overall, this is achievable if government prioritizes EU compliance and evidence over political optics."

      "summary": "The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments represent a significant public health intervention that directly addresses road traffic injuries—a leading cause of death and disability in Montenegro, particularly among young people aged 18-24. The midnight-to-5am driving ban for young drivers targets the highest-risk period for alcohol-related crashes and fatigue-related incidents. Electric scooter regulation fills a critical safety gap that has emerged across EU cities. These measures align with WHO's Safe System approach and will reduce demand on the Clinical Center of Montenegro's emergency departments and trauma services. However, the decision lacks integration with health sector expertise, omits crucial post-crash care improvements, and misses opportunities for data-sharing protocols that would enable evidence-based monitoring of public health outcomes.",
      "reasoning": "From a public health perspective, road traffic injuries constitute a major preventable cause of mortality and morbidity in Montenegro. Data from the Clinical Center of Montenegro's emergency services show that young drivers (18-24 years) are disproportionately represented in serious traffic crashes, particularly during nighttime hours when alcohol consumption, fatigue, and risk-taking behavior peak. The midnight-to-5am driving restriction for drivers aged 18-21 is evidence-based: international studies demonstrate that graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs with nighttime restrictions reduce fatal crashes among novice drivers by 10-30%.\n\nThe 80 kW engine power limit addresses another documented risk factor—young drivers operating high-performance vehicles before developing adequate hazard perception and vehicle control skills. Emergency department physicians at the Clinical Center regularly treat catastrophic injuries from high-speed crashes involving inexperienced drivers in powerful vehicles. This restriction will likely reduce the severity of injuries requiring intensive trauma care, neurosurgery, and long-term rehabilitation—services that are already stretched thin in Montenegro's small healthcare system.\n\nElectric scooter regulation is overdue from an injury prevention standpoint. Since e-scooters proliferated in Podgorica and coastal cities (2023-2025), emergency departments have documented a sharp increase in head injuries, fractures, and soft tissue trauma among users—many of them minors. The minimum age of 16 and parental liability provisions create a regulatory framework similar to successful models in Slovenia and Croatia. However, the decision omits mandatory helmet requirements, which reduce head injury severity by approximately 70% according to WHO guidelines.\n\nThe deployment of 100 digital radars and average speed measurement technology supports injury prevention through speed reduction. Excessive speed is a factor in approximately 40% of fatal crashes in Montenegro (per RFZO mortality data). Automated enforcement is more consistent than manual policing and has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing both speed and crash rates across EU member states. The vehicle seizure provision for repeat offenders removes dangerous drivers from the road, preventing injuries before they occur—a core principle of primary prevention in public health.\n\nHowever, the Ministry of Health identifies several critical gaps. First, there is no evidence that health sector expertise informed the policy design. The Ministry of Health operates the national injury surveillance system and holds detailed epidemiological data on traffic injury patterns, risk factors, and outcomes. This data should have guided the selection of interventions and their calibration (e.g., why midnight rather than 11pm or 1am? What does Montenegro-specific crash data show?). The absence of Health Ministry consultation suggests a siloed policy process that misses opportunities for evidence-based optimization.\n\nSecond, the decision focuses exclusively on prevention but ignores the post-crash care continuum. Road traffic injuries place significant strain on emergency medical services (EMS), emergency departments, intensive care units, and rehabilitation services. Montenegro's EMS response times in rural and mountainous areas remain suboptimal (often exceeding WHO's recommended 15-minute benchmark), and the Clinical Center's trauma capacity is limited. A comprehensive traffic safety strategy should include investments in trauma care systems, training for emergency responders, and protocols for rapid transfer to specialized care.\n\nThird, there is no mechanism for health data integration. Police will enforce these new regulations, but they will not systematically share data with RFZO (the health insurance fund) or the Institute of Public Health. This prevents real-time monitoring of the policy's health impact. For example, if emergency department visits for traffic injuries among 18-21 year-olds decline after the midnight curfew, that would validate the intervention. Without data-sharing protocols, such evaluation is impossible.\n\nFourth, the decision does not address alcohol-impaired driving comprehensively. While the nighttime curfew for young drivers will reduce some alcohol-related crashes, it does not tackle the broader issue of drink-driving across all age groups. Montenegro's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit of 0.03% is relatively strict, but enforcement is inconsistent, and random breath testing is underutilized. The Ministry of Health supports zero-tolerance BAC limits for all drivers and mandatory alcohol screening in emergency departments to identify high-risk individuals for brief intervention.\n\nFifth, the fines and penalties are purely punitive with no integration of health education or rehabilitation. For example, young drivers who violate the nighttime curfew could be required to complete a traffic safety education program that includes modules on injury biomechanics, alcohol effects on reaction time, and testimonials from crash survivors. Such programs have demonstrated effectiveness in changing behavior among young drivers in Finland and the Netherlands.\n\nFinally, the decision does not address vulnerable road users beyond e-scooter riders—pedestrians and cyclists. Montenegro's urban design heavily favors motor vehicles, and pedestrian fatalities remain high, particularly among the elderly. A truly comprehensive traffic safety law would include measures such as lower urban speed limits (30 km/h in residential areas), protected cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian priority zones near schools and hospitals.\n\nDespite these limitations, the decision represents meaningful progress. It applies evidence-based interventions (graduated licensing, speed enforcement, powered two-wheeler regulation) that will save lives and reduce the burden on Montenegro's healthcare system. The Ministry of Health therefore assigns a positive verdict with a score of 7/10, recognizing the public health value while noting significant opportunities for improvement through health sector integration and a more comprehensive Safe System approach.",

The core amendments are already approved—the Ministry of Health's proposal simply embeds them in a strategic framework and redirects existing resources (fine revenue) rather than requiring large new budgets. Inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms exist (Government sessions, working groups) and need formalization rather than creation from scratch. Data-sharing protocols can be established through ministerial agreement and IT integration between police systems and Institute of Public Health databases (estimated 6-9 months, modest IT investment). EMS improvements are scalable and can be phased over 2-3 years as fine revenue accumulates. Health education programs can be piloted in 2-3 municipalities before national rollout. Helmet mandates for e-scooters require regulatory amendment but face minimal implementation barriers (enforcement piggybacks on existing police authority). The primary challenge is overcoming institutional silos—Interior Ministry viewing traffic safety as an enforcement domain rather than a public health issue. However, shared outcome metrics (lives saved) and EU accession pressure for integrated governance create favorable conditions. Comparable integrated road safety strategies have been successfully implemented in Croatia (2011), Slovenia (2013), and Estonia (2015) with similar institutional starting points. Estimated implementation timeline: 6 months for strategy development and inter-ministerial agreements, 12-18 months for full operationalization of data systems and training programs, 3 years to achieve measurable health outcome improvements. Political feasibility is moderate-to-high if framed as enhancing rather than replacing the existing law, and if public communication emphasizes lives saved and healthcare cost reductions."

    "debate_transcript": "# Parliamentary Debate: Road Traffic Safety Law Amendments\n\n## Opening Remarks: Framing the Decision\n\nThe government's approval of Road Traffic Safety Law amendments on February 12, 2026 introduces three major policy changes: (1) midnight-to-5am driving ban for 18-21 year-olds, (2) first-time regulation of electric scooters with age 16 minimum and parental fines, and (3) expanded police powers including vehicle seizure and deployment of approximately 100 digital radars. The stated objective is reducing road fatalities among young people, Montenegro's most vulnerable traffic demographic.\n\nThis debate examines whether the decision strikes an appropriate balance between public safety, fiscal responsibility, constitutional rights, and economic impact.\n\n---\n\n## I. CONSENSUS AREAS: Shared Ground Across Ministries\n\n### A. Legitimacy of Public Safety Objective\n\n**The Ministry of Health** frames the urgency clearly: \"Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death and disability in Montenegro, particularly among young people aged 18-24. The midnight-to-5am driving ban targets the highest-risk period for alcohol-related crashes and fatigue-related incidents.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Education** concurs from a student welfare perspective: \"These measures directly protect our student population, particularly secondary school and university students aged 16-21 who represent a vulnerable demographic in traffic incidents.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** adds enforcement credibility: \"The young driver restrictions align with EU best practices, while electric scooter regulation addresses a genuine regulatory gap.\"\n\n**Point of consensus:** No ministry disputes that young drivers are statistically overrepresented in traffic fatalities, or that electric scooters have created an unregulated safety hazard. The policy problem is real.\n\n### B. EU Alignment and Regional Competitiveness\n\n**The Ministry of EU Integration** endorses the strategic direction: \"The Road Traffic Safety Law amendments represent a positive step toward EU acquis alignment, particularly with Directive 2015/413 on cross-border enforcement and the broader EU road safety framework.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Justice** agrees on international obligations: \"EU harmonization in road safety is positive... these measures pursue legitimate public safety objectives.\"\n\n**Point of consensus:** The decision positions Montenegro favorably in Chapter 14 (Transport Policy) negotiations and demonstrates capacity to transpose EU safety standards, a credibility signal to Brussels.\n\n### C. Need for Electric Scooter Regulation\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** identifies the gap: \"Electric scooter regulation addresses a genuine regulatory gap.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Health** quantifies the risk: \"Electric scooter regulation fills a critical safety gap that has emerged across EU cities.\"\n\n**Point of consensus:** All ministries acknowledge that Montenegro's silence on electric scooters created legal uncertainty and safety hazards. Regulation is overdue.\n\n---\n\n## II. POINTS OF CONTENTION: Where Ministries Diverge\n\n### A. Constitutional Proportionality of the Midnight Driving Ban\n\n#### **The Case for Restrictions (Health, Education, Interior)**\n\n**The Ministry of Health** presents the epidemiological argument: \"The midnight-to-5am driving ban for young drivers targets the highest-risk period for alcohol-related crashes and fatigue-related incidents. These measures align with WHO's Safe System approach and will reduce demand on the Clinical Center of Montenegro's emergency departments and trauma services.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Education** emphasizes duty of care: \"The midnight-to-5am driving ban for young drivers and electric scooter age restrictions align with our duty of care for student welfare.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** cites evidence-based policymaking: \"The young driver restrictions align with EU best practices.\"\n\n#### **The Case Against Blanket Bans (Justice, Economy)**\n\n**The Ministry of Justice** raises constitutional red flags: \"Midnight driving ban for legal adults (18-21) may violate constitutional equality (Article 8) and freedom of movement (Article 39) without clear proportionality justification or evidence base... Replace blanket midnight driving ban with evidence-based graduated licensing: zero BAC for drivers under 21, mandatory advanced training, penalty point system with lower thresholds for novices.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Economy** identifies labor market impacts: \"Youth employment mobility reduced in tourism/hospitality sectors due to midnight-to-5am driving ban, particularly in coastal areas with limited public transport... Potential negative effect on informal economy workers (20-30% of labor force) who rely on night mobility for income.\"\n\n**The Ministry of EU Integration** notes human rights concerns: \"Midnight-5am driving ban may disproportionately affect rural youth's access to employment/education without adequate public transport alternatives, raising proportionality concerns under EU fundamental rights framework.\"\n\n**Parliamentary Question:** Is a blanket age-based driving ban on legal adults constitutionally defensible, or should Montenegro adopt a graduated licensing system (as Justice recommends) that imposes stricter conditions (zero BAC, lower penalty thresholds, mandatory training) without categorical time-based restrictions?\n\n**Strongest argument for restrictions:** Health's injury data showing midnight-5am as peak crash risk period, combined with Education's duty of care for students.\n\n**Strongest argument against:** Justice's proportionality analysis and Economy's documentation of labor market impacts on night-shift workers, particularly in tourism-dependent coastal municipalities.\n\n**Potential compromise:** Justice's graduated licensing model preserves safety gains (zero BAC, heightened scrutiny) while avoiding categorical age-based freedom of movement restrictions that may fail constitutional review.\n\n---\n\n### B. Fiscal Preparedness and Budget Allocation\n\n#### **The Fiscal Skeptics (Finance, Economy)**\n\n**The Ministry of Finance** itemizes the gaps: \"No budget allocation specified for approximately 100 digital radars (estimated €1.5-5 million capital cost), absence of cost-benefit analysis comparing safety benefits to fiscal expenditure, missing revenue projections from fines despite introduction of €300-600 penalties, no assessment of recurring costs (maintenance, data processing, personnel training).\"\n\n**The Ministry of Economy** questions return on investment: \"Enforcement costs (100 digital radars, expanded police authority) represent €2-5 million fiscal commitment with no ROI analysis or efficiency benchmarks.\"\n\n#### **The Implementation Realists (Interior, EU Integration)**\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** acknowledges capacity concerns: \"No evidence of police capacity analysis for deploying and maintaining 100 digital radars and average speed systems — risks unfunded mandate and implementation failure... Absent budget allocation and procurement timeline for technology deployment — high risk of delays, cost overruns, or corrupt procurement practices.\"\n\n**The Ministry of EU Integration** offers a solution: \"No mention of IPA funding mechanisms for digital radar procurement, risking non-compliance with EU public procurement rules and missing technical assistance opportunities... Designate IPA III funding for digital radar procurement and tie it to public procurement procedures compliant with Chapter 5 benchmarks; request EC technical assistance for implementation.\"\n\n**Parliamentary Question:** Should the government halt implementation until Finance produces a full cost-benefit analysis and secures budget allocation, or proceed immediately while seeking IPA III co-financing as EU Integration recommends?\n\n**Strongest fiscal argument:** Finance's documentation that the decision lacks basic budgetary discipline—no capital cost estimates, no revenue projections, no recurring cost analysis. This violates fiscal responsibility principles.\n\n**Strongest implementation argument:** EU Integration's identification of IPA III funding as a viable path forward, transforming a fiscal liability into an EU integration opportunity with technical assistance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Parliament should condition final approval on two deliverables within 60 days: (1) Finance-certified cost-benefit analysis with 3-year fiscal impact projection, and (2) EU Integration-led IPA III funding application with procurement timeline.\n\n---\n\n### C. Enforcement vs. Prevention Balance\n\n#### **The Prevention Coalition (Health, Education, Justice)**\n\n**The Ministry of Health** advocates for behavioral intervention: \"Exclusive focus on prevention with no investment in post-crash emergency medical services, trauma care capacity, or rehabilitation... Absence of data-sharing protocols between police and health sector prevents monitoring of public health outcomes... Introduce mandatory traffic safety education programs for violators, developed by the Ministry of Health using injury data and behavioral science, as alternative or supplement to monetary fines.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Education** identifies the missing educational component: \"No integration of traffic safety education into mandatory school curriculum despite clear policy need... Purely punitive approach without educational component for young offenders (e.g., mandatory safety courses)... Mandate traffic safety module integration into final year of secondary education (age 17-18) covering new regulations, defensive driving, and consequences.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Justice** proposes graduated alternatives: \"Replace blanket midnight driving ban with evidence-based graduated licensing: zero BAC for drivers under 21, mandatory advanced training, penalty point system with lower thresholds for novices.\"\n\n#### **The Enforcement Priority (Interior)**\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** focuses on technology and police powers: \"The decision raises significant concerns about police administrative capacity, digital infrastructure readiness, data protection compliance, and the lack of a comprehensive road safety strategy integrating prevention, education, and inter-agency coordination... However, enforcement-only approach treats symptoms, not root causes.\"\n\n**Parliamentary Question:** Has the government over-indexed on enforcement technology (radars, fines, seizures) while neglecting prevention infrastructure (driver education reform, behavioral interventions, health sector integration)?\n\n**Strongest prevention argument:** Health and Education's evidence-based case that mandatory safety courses for violators and curriculum integration would reduce recidivism more effectively than fines alone, particularly for low-income youth.\n\n**Strongest enforcement argument:** Interior's acknowledgment that even with enforcement focus, the current decision lacks a \"comprehensive road safety strategy integrating prevention, education, infrastructure, and inter-agency coordination\"—conceding the prevention coalition's critique.\n\n**Recommendation:** Parliament should mandate an inter-ministerial working group (Interior, Health, Education, Transport) to develop a national road safety strategy (2026-2030) integrating enforcement, prevention, education, and infrastructure improvements, with measurable targets aligned to EU Vision Zero principles.\n\n---\n\n### D. Data Protection, Oversight, and Corruption Risks\n\n#### **The Accountability Skeptics (Justice, Interior, EU Integration)**\n\n**The Ministry of Justice** flags corruption vulnerabilities: \"Vehicle seizure provision lacks procedural safeguards, judicial oversight, and clear legal criteria—risks ECHR Article 1 Protocol 1 violations and arbitrary police discretion... Expanded police powers create corruption risks without accompanying oversight mechanisms (body cameras, ASK monitoring, transparent statistics)... Radar procurement (~100 units) lacks mentioned transparency safeguards against corrupt tendering.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** identifies GDPR gaps: \"Missing data protection impact assessment for automated enforcement systems — exposes Montenegro to GDPR non-compliance and EU criticism during Chapter 23 negotiations... Municipal police capacity varies wildly across municipalities — delegation of authority without standardized training and oversight creates enforcement gaps and corruption risks.\"\n\n**The Ministry of EU Integration** emphasizes institutional capacity: \"Lack of institutional capacity-building measures for police (training on proportionality, due process, GDPR compliance) to accompany expanded enforcement powers... Insufficient data protection safeguards detailed for radar systems and vehicle databases—GDPR compliance unclear.\"\n\n**Parliamentary Question:** Can Montenegro deploy 100 digital radars and expanded vehicle seizure powers without GDPR compliance, transparent procurement, judicial oversight, and anti-corruption safeguards?\n\n**Strongest accountability argument:** Justice's comprehensive critique documenting that vehicle seizure lacks judicial review, radar procurement lacks transparency, and municipal police expansion lacks standardized training—a trifecta of corruption risks.\n\n**Strongest counter-argument:** None. Even Interior (the implementing ministry) concedes these gaps exist and recommends remediation.\n\n**Recommendation:** Parliament should reject the decision unless amended to include: (1) mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment before radar deployment, (2) judicial authorization or 24-hour review for all vehicle seizures, (3) transparent public procurement with civil society monitoring, (4) mandatory body cameras for seizure-eligible stops, and (5) ASK oversight of enforcement statistics.\n\n---\n\n### E. Economic Impact on Youth Employment and Tourism\n\n#### **The Economic Concern (Economy, Finance)**\n\n**The Ministry of Economy** quantifies labor market effects: \"Youth employment mobility reduced in tourism/hospitality sectors due to midnight-to-5am driving ban, particularly in coastal areas with limited public transport... No consultation mentioned with Chamber of Commerce, Hospitality Association, or tourism stakeholders before approval... Potential negative effect on informal economy workers (20-30% of labor force) who rely on night mobility for income.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Finance** adds fiscal dimension: \"Potential negative impact on youth employment in night-shift sectors (tourism, hospitality)... No assessment of recurring costs, maintenance expenses, and potential impact on consumer spending by young adults.\"\n\n#### **The Public Health Rebuttal (Health, Education)**\n\n**The Ministry of Health** prioritizes lives over convenience: \"The midnight-to-5am driving ban for young drivers targets the highest-risk period for alcohol-related crashes and fatigue-related incidents. These measures align with WHO's Safe System approach and will reduce demand on the Clinical Center of Montenegro's emergency departments and trauma services.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Education** emphasizes student welfare: \"These measures directly protect our student population.\"\n\n**Parliamentary Question:** Should economic considerations (youth employment in tourism) override public health evidence on peak crash risk hours?\n\n**Strongest economic argument:** Economy's documentation that 20-30% of the labor force works in the informal economy, many in night-shift roles, combined with Finance's concern about youth consumer spending impacts.\n\n**Strongest public health argument:** Health's WHO Safe System framework and emergency department burden reduction—lives saved vs. labor market convenience.\n\n**Potential compromise:** Economy's recommendation to \"create exemptions for young workers with documented night-shift employment in registered businesses (hospitality, healthcare, transport) to preserve labor market flexibility\" could balance safety and economic needs.\n\n---\n\n### F. Electric Scooter Regulation: Incomplete Framework\n\n#### **The Safety Gap (Health, Interior, Justice)**\n\n**The Ministry of Health** identifies the helmet omission: \"Electric scooter regulation omits mandatory helmet requirements, which reduce head injury severity by ~70% and should be a baseline safety measure... Amend electric scooter regulations to require helmets for all riders and integrate with EU safety standards (EN 1078).\"\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** lists missing elements: \"Electric scooter regulation incomplete — lacks helmet requirements, speed limits, lane usage rules, rental company obligations, and insurance framework... Issue comprehensive electric scooter regulation within 90 days: helmet requirements, speed limits (25 km/h standard), dedicated lane rules, rental company licensing, insurance obligations, and import/sale standards.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Justice** notes enforcement ambiguity: \"Enforcement mechanism for scooter age restrictions unclear—risks selective and arbitrary application.\"\n\n#### **The Business Development Concern (Economy)**\n\n**The Ministry of Economy** worries about sector stagnation: \"Electric scooter regulations introduced without accompanying infrastructure investment (bike lanes, parking zones) or business development incentives... Regional competitiveness risk: Croatia and Albania investing in micro-mobility infrastructure to attract eco-conscious tourists, while Montenegro only regulates without enabling.\"\n\n**Parliamentary Question:** Should Parliament accept incomplete electric scooter regulation (no helmets, no speed limits, no rental company rules) or demand comprehensive framework before approval?\n\n**Consensus view:** All ministries agree the current electric scooter provisions are incomplete. Health, Interior, and Justice want safety additions; Economy wants infrastructure investment and business development incentives.\n\n**Recommendation:** Parliament should table the electric scooter provisions and instruct Interior to produce comprehensive regulation within 90 days incorporating: helmets (EN 1078 standard), 25 km/h speed limit, lane usage rules, rental company licensing, insurance framework, and municipal infrastructure investment plan (bike lanes, parking zones) co-financed via IPA III.\n\n---\n\n## III. CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS: Systemic Issues\n\n### A. Lack of Inter-Ministerial Coordination\n\n**The Ministry of Health** laments exclusion: \"No evidence of Ministry of Health consultation or use of health sector injury surveillance data in policy design, suggesting a siloed approach that may miss Montenegro-specific risk factors.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Education** echoes isolation: \"No integration of traffic safety education into mandatory school curriculum despite clear policy need, absence of coordination mechanism between Ministry of Education, schools, and traffic police.\"\n\n**The Ministry of EU Integration** identifies governance failure: \"Missing opportunity for regional coordination with Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania under Transport Community Treaty, weakening Western Balkans cooperation narrative... Create an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism (Interior, Transport, EU Integration, Justice) to ensure all implementing regulations undergo EU compatibility screening.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Economy** notes stakeholder exclusion: \"No consultation mentioned with Chamber of Commerce, Hospitality Association, or tourism stakeholders before approval.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Justice** faults process: \"No mention of public consultation, regulatory impact assessment, or EU directive alignment—fails EU Chapter 23 good governance standards.\"\n\n**Cross-cutting critique:** Five ministries independently identify lack of consultation, coordination, and regulatory impact assessment. This suggests the decision was rushed without proper inter-ministerial vetting or stakeholder engagement—a governance failure.\n\n**Recommendation:** Parliament should mandate 30-day public consultation period and inter-ministerial regulatory impact assessment before final vote, as Justice recommends.\n\n---\n\n### B. Missing Evidence Base and Monitoring Framework\n\n**The Ministry of Finance** notes data gaps: \"No baseline violation data to project enforcement rates and actual revenue.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Interior** identifies systemic failure: \"No systematic crash data analysis framework — fragmented reporting between police, courts, and hospitals prevents evidence-based policymaking.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Health** demands monitoring: \"Absence of data-sharing protocols between police and health sector (RFZO, Institute of Public Health) prevents monitoring of public health outcomes and evidence-based policy adjustment... Mandate data-sharing protocols requiring police to provide monthly traffic injury data to the Institute of Public Health and RFZO for real-time epidemiological monitoring and policy evaluation.\"\n\n**The Ministry of Education** wants transparency: \"Create public dashboard showing youth traffic statistics by municipality, accessible to schools for local awareness tailoring.\"\n\n**The Ministry of EU Integration** sets measurable targets: \"Establish measurable road safety targets (e.g., 20% fatality reduction by 2028) aligned with EU Vision Zero and report progress in annual EU integration reports.\"\n\n**Cross-cutting critique:** The decision lacks baseline data, monitoring mechanisms, and measurable targets—making it impossible to evaluate effectiveness or adjust policy based on evidence.\n\n**Recommendation:** Parliament should require: (1) Interior to establish centralized road crash database integrating police, hospital, and court data within 6 months, (2) Health to publish quarterly injury statistics by age group and time of day, (3) EU Integration to define measurable road safety targets aligned with Vision Zero, and (4) annual parliamentary review of outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## IV. OVERALL VERDICT: Conditional Positive with Mandatory Amendments\n\n### Synthesis of Ministry Positions\n\n**Positive (7/10):** Health, Education, Interior, EU Integration  \n**Neutral (5-6/10):** Finance, Economy, Justice\n\n**Weighted assessment:** The decision enjoys majority support among ministries for its core public safety objectives and EU alignment. However, serious implementation gaps (fiscal, constitutional, data protection, oversight) prevent unconditional endorsement.\n\n### The Strongest Arguments\n\n**In favor of the decision:**\n1. **Health's injury data:** Midnight-5am is the highest-risk period for young driver crashes; evidence-based targeting of peak danger hours will save lives and reduce emergency department burden.\n2. **EU Integration's acquis alignment:** The decision advances Chapter 14 (Transport Policy) and demonstrates Montenegro's capacity to transpose EU road safety standards.\n3. **Education's student welfare imperative:** Young drivers aged 18-21 are disproportionately students; the state has a duty of care to protect this vulnerable population.\n\n**Against unconditional approval:**\n1. **Justice's constitutional proportionality concerns:** Blanket midnight driving ban on legal adults may violate equality and freedom of movement guarantees; graduated licensing (zero BAC, heightened penalties, mandatory training) achieves safety goals without categorical age-based restrictions.\n2. **Finance's fiscal irresponsibility:** €1.5-5M capital cost for 100 radars with no budget allocation, cost-benefit analysis, or revenue projection violates basic fiscal discipline.\n3. **Interior's own capacity warnings:** The implementing ministry itself warns of \"unfunded mandate and implementation failure\" due to missing police capacity analysis, GDPR compliance, and procurement timeline.\n4. **Economy's labor market impacts:** 20-30% of workforce in informal economy, many young workers in night-shift tourism/hospitality roles, will face mobility barriers without public transport alternatives.\n\n### Parliamentary Verdict\n\nThe Montenegrin Parliament should **conditionally support** the Road Traffic Safety Law amendments, subject to mandatory revisions addressing constitutional, fiscal, and implementation gaps. The core policy intent—reducing young driver fatalities and regulating electric scooters—is sound and EU-aligned. However, the execution is premature and legally vulnerable.\n\n**Required amendments before final approval:**\n\n1. **Constitutional safeguards (Justice):** Replace blanket midnight driving ban with graduated licensing system (zero BAC for under-21, mandatory advanced training, lower penalty thresholds) to preserve safety gains while respecting freedom of movement.\n\n2. **Fiscal accountability (Finance):** Produce comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, 3-year budget impact projection, and identify funding source (IPA III co-financing or domestic budget reallocation) within 60 days.\n\n3. **Data protection compliance (Interior, EU Integration):** Commission Data Protection Impact Assessment before radar deployment; ensure GDPR compliance and Agency for Personal Data Protection approval.\n\n4. **Judicial oversight (Justice):** Amend vehicle seizure provision to require judicial authorization or 24-hour review, clear legal criteria, maximum seizure duration, and compensation for wrongful seizure.\n\n5. **Transparent procurement (Justice, Economy):** Publish radar procurement plan with technical specifications, budget, timeline, and evaluation criteria; conduct open tender with civil society monitoring.\n\n6. **Electric scooter completion (Health, Interior):** Issue comprehensive regulation within 90 days including helmets (EN 1078), 25 km/h speed limit, lane rules, rental company licensing, and insurance framework.\n\n7. **Inter-ministerial coordination (all ministries):** Establish working group (Interior, Health, Education, Transport, EU Integration) to develop national road safety strategy (2026-2030) integrating enforcement, prevention, education, and infrastructure.\n\n8. **Evidence-based monitoring (Health, Interior, EU Integration):** Create centralized crash database integrating police, hospital, and court data; mandate data-sharing protocols; set measurable Vision Zero targets; publish quarterly statistics.\n\n9. **Public consultation (Justice, Economy):** Conduct 30-day consultation with youth organizations, Chamber of Commerce, Hospitality Association, Ombudsman, and civil society before parliamentary vote.\n\n10. **Economic mitigation (Economy):** Create exemptions for documented night-shift workers in registered businesses; develop public transport improvement strategy for coastal municipalities.\n\n### Final Recommendation to Parliament\n\n**Vote to approve the Road Traffic Safety Law amendments in principle, but table final adoption pending 90-day revision period to incorporate the ten mandatory amendments above.**\n\nThis approach:\n- **Affirms the government's public safety leadership** and EU integration commitment\n- **Protects constitutional rights** by requiring graduated licensing instead of blanket age-based bans\n- **Ensures fiscal responsibility** by mandating cost-benefit analysis and IPA III funding strategy\n- **Prevents corruption** through transparent procurement, judicial oversight, and GDPR compliance\n- **Balances safety and economy** via worker exemptions and public transport investment\n- **Enables evidence-based policy** through crash data integration and measurable targets\n- **Strengthens governance** by requiring inter-ministerial coordination and public consultation\n\nThe Montenegrin people deserve road safety reforms that are **constitutionally sound, fiscally responsible, and effectively implemented**—not rushed legislation with good intentions but poor execution. Parliament's duty is to refine this decision into a model of evidence-based, rights-respecting, EU-aligned policymaking that other Western Balkan countries will emulate.\n\n---\n\n## V. CONCLUSION: A Test of Parliamentary Rigor\n\nThis debate reveals a fundamental tension in Montenegrin governance: the executive's ambition to demonstrate EU alignment and public safety leadership versus the legislature's constitutional duty to ensure fiscal discipline, fundamental rights protection, and implementation feasibility.\n\nThe Road Traffic Safety Law amendments will save lives **if implemented correctly**. They will waste taxpayer money, violate constitutional rights, and fail enforcement **if rushed through without amendments**.\n\nParliament's choice is clear: demand the rigor that the Montenegrin people and EU accession process require, or rubber-stamp a well-intentioned but legally and fiscally vulnerable decision.\n\nThe opposition's role is to hold the government accountable for the ten mandatory amendments. The ruling coalition's role is to demonstrate that it values evidence-based governance over political expediency.\n\nMontenegro's credibility in Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights) and Chapter 14 (Transport Policy) depends on getting this right."

    ],
    "overall_analysis": "This decision exemplifies well-intentioned but poorly executed policymaking—strong on political signaling, weak on evidence and implementation planning.\n\n**The Good:** The government correctly identifies young drivers and electric scooters as road safety priorities. EU data supports graduated licensing, and Montenegro's 7-8 per 100k fatality rate demands action. Digital radar deployment modernizes enforcement. The parental liability mechanism for scooter violations is legally sound and addresses a real gap.\n\n**The Bad:** This is policy theater masquerading as reform. The midnight driving ban sounds tough but lacks enforcement mechanism—will police set up checkpoints on every rural road? Young drivers will simply borrow parents' cars or register vehicles in family names. The €1.5-5M radar procurement has no budget source, no timeline, no transparency safeguards, and—critically—no cost-benefit analysis. Will 100 radars save more lives than investing €5M in EMS helicopters for rural trauma transport? We don't know, because the government didn't ask.\n\n**The Ugly:** Constitutional equality concerns are real. Legal adults (18-21) can vote, marry, own property, and serve in the military—but can't drive to a night shift? The Venice Commission would likely flag this as disproportionate. Vehicle seizure without immediate judicial review violates ECHR property rights. The law creates corruption opportunities: discretionary police powers, major procurement contract, expanded municipal police authority—all without mentioned oversight.\n\n**What Ministries Missed:** None calculated the human capital cost: every young life saved is worth ~€3-5M in lifetime productivity (EU standard). None questioned why Montenegro copies punitive EU measures (curfews, power limits) but ignores proven prevention: Sweden's Vision Zero invests in road design and trauma care; Netherlands focuses on infrastructure separation. None asked: if this works, why do France and Austria—with similar restrictions—still have higher youth fatality rates than Sweden and UK, which use education-based approaches?\n\n**The Real Story:** This decision protects the government from criticism (\"we did something about road deaths\") without solving the problem. Montenegro's road safety crisis stems from: poor road infrastructure (narrow, poorly lit mountain roads), weak DUI enforcement (breathalyzers rarely used), inadequate EMS coverage (>30min response times in rural areas), and cultural acceptance of reckless driving. A midnight curfew for 18-21 year-olds addresses none of this.\n\n**Cui Bono?** Radar vendors (€1.5-5M contract with no competitive tender safeguards). Police unions (expanded powers, bigger budgets). Politicians (\"tough on road safety\" talking points). Not benefiting: young workers losing income opportunities, rural families with limited transport options, taxpayers funding unfunded mandates, or—most importantly—the actual victims of Montenegro's road safety crisis, who will keep dying because this law tackles symptoms, not causes.\n\n**The EU Angle:** Brussels will applaud the optics (\"harmonization!\") but the European Commission's own impact assessment guidelines require cost-benefit analysis, stakeholder consultation, proportionality review, and alternatives assessment. This decision has none. If Montenegro submitted this as EU legislation, it would fail scrutiny. Why accept lower standards domestically?\n\n**Verdict:** A 6/10 decision—better than nothing, worse than evidence-based policy. It will modestly reduce some youth crashes (perhaps 5-10% among the restricted age group) while creating enforcement chaos, constitutional challenges, and missed opportunities for systemic reform. Ministries deserve 8/10 for assessment quality—they identified real concerns—but none had the courage to say: *this policy is backwards; invest in prevention, not punishment.*",

    "title": "Phased Road Safety System with Fiscal Discipline, Educational Integration, and Health Outcomes Focus",
    "executive_summary": "Instead of immediate full enforcement, implement a three-year phased road safety program combining evidence-based restrictions with institutional capacity-building, sustainable financing, and public health integration. Deploy digital radars in pilot corridors with proven cost-effectiveness thresholds, establish a self-financing Road Safety Fund from fine revenues, mandate traffic safety education in schools and driver rehabilitation programs, require judicial oversight for vehicle seizures, integrate health sector injury data into enforcement planning, and create inter-ministerial coordination to address root causes beyond policing.",
    "detailed_proposal": "The AI Government's counter-proposal maintains the core protective measures—young driver restrictions, electric scooter regulation, and modern enforcement technology—while addressing critical gaps in fiscal sustainability, constitutional compliance, educational prevention, and public health outcomes.\n\n**Phase 1: Evidence-Based Pilot (Months 0-12)**\n\nBegin with a 25-unit digital radar deployment in statistically high-risk corridors identified through joint analysis by the Ministry of Interior and Institute of Public Health injury surveillance data. This reduces upfront capital expenditure from €1.5-5 million to €375,000-1.25 million while validating cost assumptions. Expansion to 100 units proceeds only if cost-per-accident-prevented meets a €50,000 threshold, ensuring fiscal discipline and evidence-based scaling.\n\nConduct comprehensive baseline assessments: police capacity audit for enforcement technology, crash data integration pilot, regulatory impact assessment including Constitutional Court preliminary review, data protection impact assessment for GDPR compliance, and youth employment impact study focusing on tourism/hospitality night-shift workers.\n\n**Phase 2: Institutional and Legal Refinement (Months 6-18)**\n\nReplace the blanket midnight-to-5am driving ban with evidence-based graduated licensing measures that survive constitutional proportionality scrutiny: zero blood alcohol content for drivers under 21, mandatory 20-hour advanced safety training within the first year of licensure, and a penalty point system with lower thresholds for novice drivers (6 points vs. 12 for experienced drivers). Introduce work-related exemptions for young drivers with verified night-shift employment in registered businesses, protecting labor market flexibility in tourism-dependent coastal regions.\n\nAmend vehicle seizure provisions to require judicial authorization within 24 hours, clearly defined qualifying offenses, maximum 30-day seizure periods, and automatic compensation for wrongful seizures. This addresses rule of law concerns and prevents ECHR Article 1 Protocol 1 violations.\n\nExpand electric scooter regulation to include mandatory helmet requirements (EN 1078 standard), speed limits (25 km/h), dedicated lane usage rules, and rental company licensing obligations. Introduce means-tested fine structures for parental liability: €50-150 for low-income families, €150-300 for median income, €300-500 for high income, with community service alternatives.\n\n**Phase 3: Educational and Public Health Integration (Months 12-24)**\n\nMandatory 12-hour traffic safety module integrated into the final year of all secondary schools (gymnasium and vocational), covering defensive driving, legal responsibilities, injury biomechanics, and new young driver restrictions. Annual school-police partnership programs with traffic officers presenting regulations and accident case studies at all secondary schools each September.\n\nCertify Vocational Education and Training (VET) centers to deliver 8-hour road safety courses for first-time young offenders as an alternative to monetary fines, creating a rehabilitation pathway and revenue stream for VET institutions. Update VET curriculum for auto mechanics and transport technicians with a 16-hour road safety module covering vehicle dynamics and young driver risks.\n\nEstablish 'Road Trauma Reality' workshops for first-time violators, featuring health-led education on injury consequences and survivor testimonials—proven more effective than fines alone in changing long-term behavior.\n\n**Phase 4: Sustainable Financing and Transparency (Ongoing)**\n\nCreate a dedicated Road Safety Fund where all fine revenue is earmarked for safety infrastructure and services, ensuring self-financing and preventing revenue diversion. Allocate fund resources: 30% to school-zone safety infrastructure (crosswalks, speed bumps, signage near hospitals and schools), 30% to Emergency Medical Services modernization (trauma training, ambulance renewal, rural response time improvements), 20% to educational materials and public awareness campaigns, 10% to University of Montenegro road safety research with graduate student involvement, 10% to administration and monitoring.\n\nEstablish transparent revenue-sharing: 70% central government, 30% municipalities for parking fines, incentivizing local enforcement while preserving central budget revenues.\n\nPublish quarterly public dashboards tracking fine revenue, enforcement costs, accident rates, injury severity trends, youth employment effects, and return-on-investment. This ensures accountability and enables data-driven policy adjustments.\n\n**Phase 5: Inter-Ministerial Coordination and Health Outcomes (Months 18-36)**\n\nCreate a permanent National Road Safety Council co-chaired by the Ministers of Interior and Health, with mandatory participation from Transport, Education, Justice, Finance, and Economy. The Council meets quarterly using integrated data from police enforcement, health sector injury surveillance (Institute of Public Health, Clinical Center emergency departments), and economic indicators (tourism employment, informal sector activity).\n\nMandatory real-time data exchange: police provide crash and citation data to the Institute of Public Health within 48 hours, enabling epidemiological monitoring and evidence-based enforcement priority-setting. Use health sector injury mapping to guide radar placement, prioritizing high-injury corridors rather than revenue-generating highways.\n\nExpand beyond young driver focus to address vulnerable road users: 30 km/h urban speed limits near schools and hospitals, protected cycling infrastructure investment, pedestrian priority zones informed by health injury data.\n\nIntroduce comprehensive alcohol strategy: zero-BAC for all drivers (not just young/novice), random breath testing authority, and emergency department screening protocols to identify high-risk individuals for brief intervention.\n\n**Phase 6: EU Integration and Regional Leadership (Months 12-36)**\n\nExplicitly cite EU Directive 2015/413 on cross-border enforcement and the Road Safety Action Programme 2021-2030 in the law's preamble, demonstrating acquis transposition for Chapter 14 (Transport Policy) and Chapter 23 (Judiciary and Fundamental Rights).\n\nEstablish a roadmap for EUCARIS (European Car and Driving License Information System) integration by 2027, with bilateral data-exchange agreements with Croatia, Serbia, Albania, and Bosnia-Herzegovina for cross-border enforcement.\n\nDesignate IPA III as the primary funding source for digital radars and capacity-building, ensuring compliance with EU public procurement rules and leveraging €2-4 million in potential technical and financial assistance.\n\nInitiate a Regional Road Safety Working Group under the Transport Community Treaty, with Montenegro hosting a ministerial conference in Q3 2026 to position the country as a reform leader and create harmonized Western Balkans standards.\n\n**Phase 7: Evaluation and Adaptation (Years 2-3)**\n\nInclude a 3-year sunset clause for all young driver restrictions, requiring mandatory independent evaluation of road safety outcomes, constitutional rights impact, health metrics (lives saved, serious injuries prevented, disability-adjusted life years), and economic effects before renewal.\n\nSet measurable targets aligned with EU Vision Zero: 20% reduction in road traffic fatalities by 2028, 30% reduction in serious injuries, specific sub-targets for 18-21 age group based on baseline data.\n\nIf fine revenue fails to cover 80% of enforcement costs within 24 months, the program undergoes mandatory review and potential restructuring to ensure fiscal sustainability.\n\n**Municipal Police and Anti-Corruption Safeguards**\n\nDelay delegation of expanded municipal police authority until standardized training, equipment, and anti-corruption oversight are certified by the Ministry of Interior. Prioritize municipalities meeting defined capacity thresholds.\n\nRequire body cameras for all traffic enforcement interactions involving potential vehicle seizure or fines exceeding €200, with footage retained for 90 days and accessible to defendants. The Agency for Prevention of Corruption (ASK) publishes quarterly statistics on seizures by region and officer to detect patterns of abuse.\n\nSubject all radar procurement to enhanced transparency: public tender with published evaluation criteria, State Audit Institution pre-approval, real-time contract publication on gov.me, and civil society observer participation.\n\n**Implementation Feasibility**\n\nThis phased approach is highly feasible because it builds on the government's existing decision rather than replacing it, requires no additional legislative approvals beyond refinements, and leverages available EU IPA III funding. The Ministry of Interior already possesses crash location data; the Institute of Public Health operates injury surveillance systems; schools have existing civic education frameworks; and VET centers have accreditation infrastructure. The main challenge is inter-ministerial coordination, addressable through existing Government Coordination Body mechanisms with a clear Prime Minister's Office mandate. Total additional first-year cost: €200,000-500,000, largely offset by fine revenue and EU co-financing within 18-24 months.",

    "implementation_steps": [
      "Month 0-3: Government adopts phased implementation decree; establishes National Road Safety Council (Interior-Health co-chairs); initiates Constitutional Court preliminary review of amended provisions; launches youth employment impact study (Economy + Interior + Hospitality Association)",
      "Month 3-6: Complete police capacity audit and crash data integration pilot; conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment for radar systems (AZLP approval); publish transparent procurement plan for 25 pilot radars with State Audit Institution pre-approval; establish police-health real-time data exchange protocols",
      "Month 6-9: Deploy 25 digital radars in high-injury corridors identified by Institute of Public Health data; begin body camera rollout for traffic police; launch public consultation (30 days) on implementing regulations via e-uprava platform; certify 3-5 VET centers for offender rehabilitation courses",
      "Month 9-12: Integrate 12-hour traffic safety module into secondary school curriculum (ministerial order); pilot 'Road Trauma Reality' workshops in Podgorica, Budva, Kotor; establish Road Safety Fund with transparent accounting on gov.me; publish first quarterly dashboard (enforcement costs, accident trends, fine revenue)",
      "Month 12-18: Evaluate pilot radar cost-effectiveness (cost-per-accident-prevented); if threshold met, procure additional 75 units via transparent tender; implement graduated licensing system (zero BAC, penalty points, training requirements); introduce work-related exemption application process for young night-shift workers",
      "Month 18-24: Amend vehicle seizure provisions to require judicial authorization within 24 hours; implement means-tested fine structure; expand VET certification to 10-15 centers nationwide; launch University of Montenegro 3-year longitudinal road safety study; allocate 30% fine revenue to EMS modernization (trauma training, rural ambulance renewal)",
      "Month 24-30: Host Montenegro-led Regional Road Safety Ministerial Conference under Transport Community Treaty; finalize EUCARIS integration roadmap; invest in school-zone safety infrastructure (crosswalks, speed bumps) using Road Safety Fund; introduce 30 km/h urban speed limits near schools/hospitals based on health injury mapping",
      "Month 30-36: Commission independent evaluation of young driver restrictions (safety outcomes, constitutional rights impact, economic effects); publish comprehensive impact assessment; deploy remaining radars (if pilot successful); strengthen municipal police capacity in certified municipalities; introduce zero-BAC for all drivers and random breath testing",
      "Month 36+: Review sunset clause evaluation; decide on renewal, adjustment, or discontinuation of young driver restrictions based on evidence; scale successful interventions (education programs, health workshops, infrastructure investments); submit progress report to European Commission demonstrating Chapter 14 and Chapter 23 alignment"

    "risks_and_tradeoffs": [
      "**Implementation complexity**: Phased approach with multiple inter-ministerial workstreams requires strong coordination capacity—risk of delays if Prime Minister's Office doesn't mandate clear timelines and accountability. Mitigation: Establish dedicated Road Safety Secretariat within Government General Secretariat with full-time coordinator.",
      "**Political resistance to pilot approach**: Government may face public criticism for 'going slow' on road safety, especially if high-profile accidents occur during pilot phase. Mitigation: Proactive communication emphasizing evidence-based policymaking and showcasing pilot results; quick-win measures like school-zone speed limits can demonstrate immediate action.",
      "**Judicial capacity constraints**: Requiring 24-hour judicial review of vehicle seizures may strain Basic Courts already facing backlogs. Mitigation: Streamline with dedicated traffic judges or administrative review panels; provide judicial training on proportionality standards; limit seizures to truly serious repeat offenders.",
      "**Youth employment disruption**: Even with work-related exemptions, some young workers in informal economy or gig employment may face mobility challenges. Mitigation: Expand exemption criteria to include documented irregular shift patterns; pilot subsidized late-night public transport in Budva-Kotor corridor during summer season.",
      "**Constitutional Court rejection**: If preliminary review identifies insurmountable constitutional issues with any provisions, implementation timeline extends. Mitigation: Engage Constitutional Court informally early in drafting; have fallback graduated licensing models (e.g., passenger restrictions instead of time restrictions) ready.",
      "**Revenue shortfall**: If fine collection rates are lower than projected (due to reduced violations or enforcement gaps), Road Safety Fund may be underfunded. Mitigation: 80% revenue threshold triggers program review; secure IPA III baseline funding for critical elements (EMS, education); phase infrastructure investments based on actual revenue accumulation.",
      "**Municipal capacity gaps**: Many municipalities lack resources for standardized training and equipment, delaying expanded authority delegation. Mitigation: Prioritize 5-7 largest municipalities initially; provide central budget support for training; accept gradual rollout over 2-3 years.",
      "**Technology procurement risks**: Digital radar procurement vulnerable to delays, cost overruns, or corrupt practices. Mitigation: Transparent tender with civil society observers; prefer proven vendors with regional references; include performance guarantees and maintenance contracts; State Audit Institution pre-approval.",
      "**Inter-agency data sharing obstacles**: Police, health, and education sectors have legacy IT systems that may not integrate easily. Mitigation: Start with manual quarterly data exchange; invest in interoperability using IPA III digital governance funds; adopt open data standards (CSV, API).",
      "**Public resistance to comprehensive alcohol enforcement**: Zero-BAC for all drivers and random breath testing may face cultural pushback in a society with social drinking norms. Mitigation: Phase in gradually with extensive public awareness campaigns; emphasize health outcomes and EU alignment; start with young drivers (less politically sensitive) before expanding.",
      "**EU funding delays**: IPA III disbursement often faces bureaucratic delays, risking timeline slippage. Mitigation: Front-load critical steps with national budget; use IPA for non-urgent capacity-building (training, research); maintain parallel national funding track.",
      "**Evaluation gaming**: Stakeholders may manipulate crash reporting or enforcement statistics to show favorable evaluation results. Mitigation: Independent evaluation by external researchers (e.g., University of Montenegro + regional partner); cross-reference multiple data sources (police, health, insurance); public data transparency prevents selective reporting."
